the friday five

1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  
    No. My stuff is always in some sort of disarray.
2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  
    Nope.
3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  
    No way! Clutter city -- at home and at work.
4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  
    My CDs are alphabetized, but only because someone did it for me when I was moving. At least, I think they made it out of the box still in order.
5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  
    My life!!
