I signed up for a 30 day meditation challenge from doyouyoga.com. It started a few weeks ago, but since it's all available online, I haven't started yet. I keep coming up with excuses. Last year, I bought a book about meditating (which I haven't read yet) and a cushion to sit on (that I haven't sat on yet), so I'd have fewer excuses.

I really feel like it could be a good thing for me, a way to de-stress and re-center my self during a period of my life that's been pretty full of changes lately. But for some reason, I just can't get started. The closest I've come is using the "Calm" app for iOS, which is not really meditation, but more like relaxation.

What are my excuses? Oh, there are so many.

- I'm traveling, so I should wait until I get back so I can actually do it every day
- It'd be better to start on \[any day of the week that isn't today\]
- I don't have the time
- I did yoga today
- I ran today so I don't have time
- There's too much stuff to do around the house
- I'm tired
- I'm busy

I'm not sure any of these are actually good reasons. I still find time to read (12 books so far this year), keep up with my favorite shows, and socialize with my friends. It's only 10-13 minutes per day. This is HALF the time it takes to watch one episode of Big Bang Theory.

I think I just need to toughen up and do it. I will do the first one after I finish this post, and I will report back in a few days.

If you'd like to join me, it's free. You can sign up here -> http://www.doyouyoga.com/lesson/day-1-getting-started-with-meditation/

**Have you tried meditation? Is there anything in your life that you want to do but always seem to make excuses to avoid doing?**
