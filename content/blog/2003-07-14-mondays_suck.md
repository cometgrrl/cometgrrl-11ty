the friday five 1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it? Probably Jessica, who lived next door when I was 4. We ended up in the hospital together after taking too many Flintstone vitamins. I would not recommend that, they make you drink castor oil (I believe) and after you puke, then they make you drink a CHARCOAL (literally) milkshake. This is to absorb the excess iron. Why they didn't just pump my stomach I'm not sure.... 2. Are you still in touch with this person? No. 3. Do you have a current close friend? Yes. 4. How did you become friends with this person? Kind of vague. I have more than one close friend. But I'll pick Christina. Christina and I met in Biology class on the first day of high school. 5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why? I have lots of friends I wish I was still in contact with.... I miss Jennifer C, Jenni D, Cherylyn from high school, Matha from HCC, Ryan from HS and Gav... (I wonder if he's still in the Navy??)... and every now and then I feel like I miss my ex, but then I remember what happened, and \*zap\*, that feeling is gone. Why do I wish I was still in contact with these people? They were good friends at one time. And everyone needs good friends, people you can count on to be there for you. Most of the people from HS might actually still be in that area, so maybe when I'm back there I might find them. Would be fun to try and get together.
