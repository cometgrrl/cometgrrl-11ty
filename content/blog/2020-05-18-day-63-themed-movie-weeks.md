My friend Beth mentioned that she and her husband have been doing themed cocktail weeks. Gin one week, vodka the next, then rum and so on.

I thought it would be interesting to try to do some theme weeks around movies.

So far, these are my ideas:

- Apocalypse or end of the world
    - Contagion
    - 28 Days Later
    - Melancholia
    - Knowing
    - Dr. Strangelove
- Musicals and/or dance movies (I own all of these, so this is an easy category!)
    - Center Stage
    - Step-Up
    - Dirty Dancing
    - Grease
    - Rocky Horror Picture Show
    - Moulin Rouge
    - Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog
- 80s Classics
    - Ferris Bueller's Day Off
    - Ghostbusters
    - Back 2 the Future
    - Indiana Jones
    - Dirty Dancing (in case I don't get to it for the previous week, HA!)
- Animated movies
    - sooooooo many to choose from!

Any suggestions for themes or movies (even if they don't fit these themes)?
