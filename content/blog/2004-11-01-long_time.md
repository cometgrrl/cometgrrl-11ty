It's been a long time since I've added an entry. I've got grand plans for the website, I just never seem to have the time (or use it, when I do have it) to update it. In the future, I'd like to add a list of my books and a whole log of the books I'm reading and the little mini-reviews I like to write. Currently, I'm reading _The Dark Tower VII - The Dark Tower_ by Stephen King. It's the last in the long, long Dark Tower series, and I'm not quite sure I want to finish it because that will mean I've reached the end. The other big news of late is my trip to Las Vegas. Darren and I are going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. I'm finally going to meet his parents, I hope I'm up for it.
