I don’t think I would ever write an autobiography, mainly because I think I’m boring. But, for the purposes of answering today’s writing prompt, I’ll consider it.

Naming the chapters after books, video games, or tv shows makes the most sense to me.

Something like:

- The Cat in Hat

- The Baby Sitters Club

- Sweet Valley High

- Xanth

- The Dark Tower

- Outlander

Otherwise,maybe by dates, like a blog or diary. Or “From A to Z”, with 26 chapters.

Today’s #Bloganuary prompt: **What would you title the chapters of your autobiography?**
