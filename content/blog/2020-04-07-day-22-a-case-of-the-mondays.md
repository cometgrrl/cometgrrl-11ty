Today was definitely Monday. That's one thing that hasn't changed in all this -- Mondays still suck.

Roxy doesn't like Mondays either.

On a brighter note, my technical issues with my blog are resolved. Tech support from my hosting company _tried_ to help, but their solution was to suggest using a plugin to bypass uploading images using WP and instead upload them using FTP, and then use the plugin to import them. Ugh. That's almost as bad as the suggestion to screenshot the photos.

After doing more research of my own, it turns out that a recent update to WordPress introduced a limit on large images. Way to go WordPress. Thankfully, there's a plugin to bypass that. And another plugin to optimize and auto re-size images. Now everything should work and be faster!

In other news -- it's April! It doesn't feel like April with all the rain we've been having here. I'm excited that the sun should be back out tomorrow. It's my birthday month, and with everything that's been going on, I've forgotten to celebrate each day. So that's gotta change.

To start, I've been decorating my new home desk. Anyone who's seen my office at work knows that I have a lot of cute stuff in my office, including way too many stuffed animals and even a TARDIS!

The Rock, ❤️dogs, and how I'm keeping hydrated.

Also, has it really been over three weeks??!

Update — as of today, I officially have more views for 2020 so far than all of last year. I’m also posting a lot more so I’d be disappointed if it the views stayed the same since I hardly posted at all last year. Thanks for reading! Drop me a comment if you like the blog or you have a suggestion for a topic.
