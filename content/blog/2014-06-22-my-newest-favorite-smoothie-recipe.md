I love smoothies, but I tend to get make the same thing over and over until I get bored with it.  My latest favorite, a chocolate almond butter smoothie, is no exception.  I came across the recipe here, and with a few modifications, it was soon my go to smoothie recipe.

After a long run, I find this really enjoyable and refreshing. Be warned, the recipe makes a LOT, and you could almost divide it into two servings. If you're hungry though, it's so good, you just might finish it all, like I do!

My adaptation:

- 1 cup plant-based milk 
- 1 serving vegan chocolate protein powder
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 2 tbsp almond butter (I like Adam's)
- 1 frozen banana (if using a fresh banana, just add ice)
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric

Toss it all in the blender, and blend!
