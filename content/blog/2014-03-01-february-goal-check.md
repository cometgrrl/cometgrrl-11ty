Well, 2 months down, 10 to go.

I have been making fair progress on my goals, with the most progress with reading, which is not surprising. I have nailed the non-fiction books, reading _The Bright Idea Box, A Short History of Nearly Everything,_ and _The Lean Startup_ so far this year. I'm also almost done with _Anna Karenina._

For running, it's been quite challenging the last week. It's hard enough to be motivated at home, but even harder when I am traveling. I managed to squeeze in 2 miles, but that was it for the whole trip! I also skipped my first race this year as my knee wasn't feeling that great, but I'm glad I went to the Bay Breeze 5k. I want to dedicate some time this month to come up with a complete training plan and schedule to prepare for my 1/2 in May.

Yoga is also hard when traveling, but I did complete a 10 day yoga challenge in January and I went to not one but two bikram yoga classes just before my business trip.

Spanish will be a focus when I return. I have made a lot of progress with Duolingo on my iPhone, but I find that Fluenz is really a better learning tool for me. I seem to have a more comprehensive understanding of the topics and grammar when I learn using Fluenz vs Duolingo.
