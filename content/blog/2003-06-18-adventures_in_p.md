I thought it would be a good idea to start giving Comet his haircuts at home. For just over the price of one trip to the groomer's, I was able to purchase a pet clipper set. THIS WAS SUCH AN ORDEAL! I had no idea what I was getting into. Problem one: came home yesterday, brushed, washed and dried Comet. (that takes 1 to 1 and a half hours). 10 minutes into clipping, and the DAMN CLIPPERS DIED. Comet looked so silly with only half his body trimmed short. Problem two: replaced the clippers today, started clipping again. Comet does not like to hold still and had accumulated a lot of matts. He's done now tho. And he actually looks kinda cute. Uneven, but cute.
