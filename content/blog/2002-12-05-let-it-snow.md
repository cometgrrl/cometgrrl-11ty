We're expecting "3 to 6 inches" of snow tonight and throughout the day tomorrow. The winter weather advisory says the snow should be in Washington by midnight (which has passed already) and in Baltimore by 2 am. I'm right in the middle, so does that mean I'll have snow at 1 am (30 minutes away!)?

If it does snow, I'm supposed to work from home tomorrow. And I will… but this way, I get to sleep in, wear my pjs all day, take as many smoke breaks as I want, stop to play video games, etc….

So……….

**LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW!!**
