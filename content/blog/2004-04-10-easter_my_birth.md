So. tomorrow is Easter. It's also my birthday. Darren suggested we should call it "Brie-ster". I like the sound of that, my holiday now has an official, unique name. It's been three days, so maybe it's time to share the news with everyone... I quit smoking! =) I'm so happy that I have finally found the strength to do it, and finally realized that it isn't as hard as I imagined it might be. Work has been really busy, we've got a big project to complete this month, so it's been really hectic. And yesterday, after a crappy day at the office, what did I come to find but an early birthday present! 2 dozen red roses. Wow. That really brightened up my day. Got lots of family coming tomorrow for "Brie-ster", I have to clean the bathroom and vacuum around the house. Happy Brie-ster! HA! =)
