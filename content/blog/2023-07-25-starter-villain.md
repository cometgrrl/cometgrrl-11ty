I'm a huge fan of John Scalzi. I've enjoyed everything of his that I've read. Lately, it seems like I alternate between reading a new release of his with something older (that I haven't read before).

Most recently, this was _The Android's Dream_, followed by _Starter Villain_ which is not even a new release, but _pre-release!_ I feel so special to read this before everyone else, and I do not mean that sarcastically or facetiously. My only regret is that _Starter Villain_ will soon be an audiobook narrated by Wil Wheaton, and there is no better combo than Scalzi + Wheaton.

This book is fun, witty, and down-right LOL funny at points. _Starter Villain_ definitely lands in the quirky category for me. Those of you that prefer your science fiction to be super super serious might not enjoy this one as much as I did! I mean , c'mon, there's cat in a business suit on the cover!

The downside? _Starter Villain_ is apparently a stand-alone novel, so we won't be getting more stories about Charlie. Perhaps the cats (or the dolphins?) could get a spin-off? I really enjoyed the world building here and I was disappointed to have it end. This one is a bit on the shorter side, and pacing wise, I felt the very beginning dragged a bit and the end was rushed.

If you like sci-fi, Scalzi, or just want to read something really unique and entertaining, I highly recommend picking up _Starter Villain_ when it comes out later this year.
