I decided to challenge myself to eat gluten free for 2 weeks. I have found lately that I often feel icky, bloated, etc around dinner time or after eating. I thought I would see if this improved or not if I eliminated gluten for awhile.

I have to say, I did pretty good! The first mishap was that I failed to think about dinner at the Maroon 5 concert. Food was included but it was barely vegetarian, let alone gluten free or vegan. I had bread and cheese for dinner on day 4. I did well until a week later, when I absentmindedly ate one of those little mini pretzels. The last mishap was day 13 at a company offsite. They had a vegetarian meal for me -- a gluten filled veggie burger, bun, pasta salad, garlic bread, and cake. I skipped the cake, but I must confess that I had 5 pieces of garlic bread (they were small pieces!!!)

Officially, yesterday was my last day. On two of the days I had gluten, I felt really crappy in the afternoon/early evening of the next day. Oddly, the day I had the most gluten, I felt fine the next day. What I realized is the first two days where I had gluten, I also had a LOT of cheese. I eat vegan about 75% of the time (or at least, I try to) so I wonder if it was the cheese.

Guess I know what the next dietary challenge will be!
