According to RunKeeper, I ran 14.2 miles last week.  And that's not including my 4 mile hike last weekend!  :)

Typically, I've run 10 miles or less per week, with a few weeks around 13 miles.  Most of these were during my training for the San Jose Rock 'n Roll 1/2 marathon (my first 13.1!) last year, and the record week was just before I got sick in September, when I ran just over 25 miles in one week.  Compare that with the two weeks leading up to the race (which was when I was sick), I only managed one easy run (3.5 miles) and one long run (9.25 miles).  In fact, I am still amazed that I ran that race and that I finished without dying...

I also ran my fastest 1 mile on the treadmill this week.  But, since I'm so slow, I'm not going to tell you what my pace was!  I am pretty sure I have run a mile faster, but this is the fastest-that-could-not-possibly-be-a-result-of-GPS-error.  :)
