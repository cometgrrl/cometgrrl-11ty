From Oxford Languages, by way of Google:

suc·cess /səkˈses/ noun: **success**; plural noun: **successes**

1. the accomplishment of an aim or purpose.  
    "there is a thin line between success and failure"
    - the attainment of fame, wealth, or social status.  
        "her success owed more to hard work than luck"
    
    - a person or thing that achieves desired aims or attains fame, wealth, etc.  
        "overall the fair was a great success"

3. **ARCHAIC** the good or bad outcome of an undertaking.  
    "the good or ill success of their maritime enterprises"

If I had to pick a definition, I'd go with the first one—the accomplishment of an aim or purpose.

Uninspired by today's prompt, I had more fun crafting the featured image for this post using Dall•E. I asked for a princess on the flag pole next to the castle at the end of a level from Super Mario Bros. I don't think it nailed it, and the princess is certainly a bit funky looking... but it will do!

Today's #Bloganuary prompt: **How do you define success?**
