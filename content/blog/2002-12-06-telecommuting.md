Working from home turned out to be more of a pain than I thought it would be. It's been nothing but a hassle. Microsoft word won't save to my network, because the file is huge (224 pages, including lots of graphics). So I have to save it here and then copy it and that takes 10 minutes. I can't imagine how slow it would be if I was using dial-up instead of cable modem.

I've said I would love to work from home all the time, but I realize why companies (like mine) don't want everyone doing it. I've been watching tv, decorated my xmas tree, went out and played in the snow…. but on the flip side, it's 3 hours past when I would normally be done at work and I'm still attempting to get some stuff done.

One of the best benefits of being at home is that I don't have to put up with management and I don't need to ask permission to take a lunch break. Comet likes having me work from home, this way he doesn't have to spend the day at home alone. He's been enjoying (somewhat) the wintery weather we've had today. He's so cute in the snow, but I know he must be freezing… he comes in all covered with little snowballs stuck all over him.
