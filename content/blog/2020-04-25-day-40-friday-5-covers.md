1. **What are you using for a face covering when you venture out?** one of several masks that I ordered from Etsy
2. **Whatâ€™s a recent cover you like of a song you already liked?** I'm not sure I know of a recent cover of a song I already liked.
3. **How good are you at keeping track of food storage container lids?** They are all in a pile next to the containers, so A+ for me, because I don't think any are missing...
4. **When did you last cover for someone?** I'm not sure, I don't think anyone has asked me to cover for them in recent memory, and in general, I'm in favor of people owning stuff and not asking for someone to "cover" for them..
5. **In your residence, what has a special cover?** The fire pit has a cover, beyond that, I can't think of anything else....

Brought to you by Friday 5.
