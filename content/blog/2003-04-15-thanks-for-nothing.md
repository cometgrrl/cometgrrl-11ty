There's a certain someone, who we'll call "D"….. if he happens to read this, which I don't think he does, well he'll know who he is.

Anyway, he was unsupportive of my decision to apply to UCSD for grad school and basically said I wasn't cut out for it and implied I wasn't smart enough…. hahah with friends like that, who needs enemies, right?

So a very sarcastic "thanks" to D…. for telling me how it was.

I'm not giving up tho… there's still one school I haven't heard from, and many many others to apply to once I retake the GREs and don't fuck up the math section! =)
