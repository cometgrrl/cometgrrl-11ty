Monday started off as a pretty crappy day for various reasons, but it's turning out to not be so bad after all. My boss just came in to talk to me to tell me that when my contract expires (which is later this month, apparently my contract has to be renewed every 3 months with the agency), he's giving me a raise. AND, on top of that, starting possibly in June, they are going to make me a full-time, regular employee with benefits! That paid vacation I've been hoping for may be coming sooner than I thought. Of course, this means I'll lose out on paid overtime (yet gain health insurance, sick leave, and paid holidays), but I'm hoping that since he mentioned the middle of June, it might just work out that I'll get mucho overtime between now and then and convert to being salaried just in time for the return to normal hours. **\=)**
