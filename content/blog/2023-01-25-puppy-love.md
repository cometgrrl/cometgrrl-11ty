I have not thought recently about how I show love. A while back, I did the quiz from the book about Love Languages.

I'm pretty sure I scored high in gifts, acts of service, and maybe food. There's really not one answer here. It depends on who you are. It depends on who I am at that particular moment.

If you're one of my dogs, you get shown love through walks, grooming, affection (lots of affection), toys, birthday celebrations, treats, and of course, getting dressed up in dresses, PJs, and Halloween costumes.

If you're anyone else... if you know, let me know, OK?

Today's #Bloganuary prompt: **How do you show love?**
