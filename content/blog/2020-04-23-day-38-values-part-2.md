I posted awhile back about values. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and how understanding what my values are can help me live a better (happier?) life.

Being in quarantine and barely leaving the house for 38 days at this point is really bringing up a lot of anxiety for me. Part of this might be that two of my core personal values are directly impacted -- freedom and connection. In case you forgot, my core values are freedom, connection (family), entertainment, and curiosity/wisdom.

While writing this, I've realized that part of why I started blogging daily is connection. I feel more connected, both to myself and my feelings, and others when I'm writing. And as for freedom, well lately that's turned into not putting any limits on what I'm eating, and I'm not sure that's so great for me in the long run, but it is what is for now.

Anyway, I thought I'd share with you the other part of my exercise to help understand what my core values are. As I mentioned, after thinking about 5 pretty straightforward questions, those answers turned into this mind map which turned into the values I mentioned earlier in this post.
