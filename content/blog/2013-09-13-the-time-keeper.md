_The Time Keeper_ by Mitch Albom

This is the first I've read by Mitch Albom, and I was a bit surprised. I had certain expectations, and I think this novel fell short.

Dor, later known as Father Time, is fascinating with counting, and invents the first clock in this whimsical novel.  After inventing his clock, Dor becomes obsessed with time and counting it.  After watching his wife die, Dor challenges the will of God, and as punishment, Dor is sentenced to a cave to hear the cries of others.

Finally, after hundreds of years in the cave, he is released on the condition that he must help two others, Sarah and Victor, who are troubled by the bounds of time.

This latter part of the novel is set in contemporary times. Sarah is a teenager who is having both parental issues and boy trouble. Victor is an extravagantly rich, elderly man, who wants to buy his way out of death.

This part of the novel is where I lost interest. I kept reading in the hopes that it would get better, but ultimately it didn't. The life changing moment didn't come for me. I don't want to spoil the end for anyone who might read it, so I will only say that I found it to be rather predictable.

My rating: 3 / 5
