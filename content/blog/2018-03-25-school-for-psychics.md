School for Psychics by K.C. Archer is a fast, fun read. Teddy, our main character, has always been able to sense when people are lying. Using this to her advantage, she’s gotten into a bit of trouble in the casinos of Las Vegas. Worried about the impact to her adoptive family, she’s in it for one last big gamble.

When a strange man rescues her and offers a place at Whitfield Institue for Law Enforcement Training and Development (i.e. a School for Psychics), Teddy reluctantly applies.

What follows is entertaining and fun. At the Institute there is intrigue and mystery surrounding the forces behind the school and disappearing students.

As Teddy struggles to find her place, she learns about her psychic abilities, her past, and her birth parents. I'm curious to see where the series will go and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
