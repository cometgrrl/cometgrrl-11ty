I started watching The Simpsons, from the beginning, back in 2018. I made it through seasons 1 & 2 and part of season 3 before all this happened.

Now that all episodes are available on Disney+, that makes things a little easier. I'm up to season 5 at this point, and I have close to 600 episodes to go to catch up.

An interesting data point -- it wasn't until S4E20 and S4E21 that I felt like I hadn't seen the episode before. However, I know there will be many, many episodes in the remaining 600 that are completely new. And sure enough S4E22 was again familiar.

Speaking of S4E21 - Marge in Chains -- the opening of the episode features the "Osaka Flu"... reminds me a lot of current times....

I remember thinking, early on, that this show was a great example of social commentary. I tried to get my dad to watch it, but he is very anti anything animated. Once he watched part of the movie Cool World with me and he said something like "now I understand what goes on in your teenage brain" and he vowed to never watch anything animated again. First of all, I think he failed to understand that I was watching the movie primarily for the non-animated parts, and of course, because this is a Brad Pitt movie. However, regarding animated movies/tv, I feel like he is really missing out. There's this misunderstanding that animated = cartoons = for kids only.

I am a huge fan of animated movies, even, maybe especially, ones for kids, but there's a wealth of animated stuff out there that's geared towards adults -- The Simpsons, Archer, and so. Maybe Ricky and Morty, although I've only seen a few episodes.

Anyone else out there a fan of The Simpsons? What's your opinion on animated shows and/or movies?
