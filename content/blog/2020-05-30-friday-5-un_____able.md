Late again! This one is really late... so I might skip posting for Saturday.

1. **What’s a movie you once liked but is now unwatchable?** _Honestly, most of the movies I loved, I still love. However, I will say that I struggled to watch Willow as an adult_
2. **What’s a song you once liked but is now unlistenable?** _I went through a period where I listened to things like Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies_. _Happily, that period ended, and I'm not really into hardcore music like that anymore._
3. **What’s a book you once liked but is now unreadable?** _oh, this is tough. I've read so many books. And so few that I read more than once. Maybe Mute by Piers Anthony? Although, I'm not sure I really liked it the first time I read it, back in high school._
4. **What’s something you once found unbelievable but whose truth is now undeniable?** _It's ok to fail. You aren't going to have many successes in life without a lot of failures first. Few things that really matter succeed on the first try._
5. **What’s something you once found tasty but is now unpalatable?** _Hamburgers_, _meat in general. Becoming a vegetarian was one of the easiest hard things I've ever done._

Brought to you by Friday 5.
