\[I was going to create a new category called "google facts", but as it is, I already have a few categories that I don't use very often. If I post these often, it might get added!\] Google facts for the day: -- Those round, bamboo chairs often sold at Pier 1 are called _papasan chairs_. -- _The Hibiscus_ is the flower commonly seen in Hawaiian print, such as Hawaiian shirts.
