The insurance company estimated about $1130 to fix my car, however, they sent me a check for $1356 plus $112 for a rental… so I might just have some left over! =) I'm already working on getting a friend to drive me to and from work while my car is in the shop, and I told her I'd split the rental car money with her, something like $10 for each day she drives me.

I hope they don't realize they made a mistake and ask for it back!

Oh, my roommate is pissing me off. She keeps leaving me notes to clean this or do that, and signing her name and Robin's. Or saying "I hope I'm not being bitchy, but Robin agrees with me." …. Robin wasn't even asked about it. It's so petty… she leaves such a mess in the kitchen, doesn't usually clean the counters, uses all the dishes, and then doesn't empty the dishwasher (she is the only one that uses it, I got tired of emptying it all the time when 80% or more the stuff in it was hers). And now she insists that it's my turn to mop the floor. It doesn't really look dirty to me, I think it can wait. In my first apartment, I don't think we ever mopped the floor, unless it was right before we moved out. The last one, we mopped maybe two or three times…. the floor just doesn't need to be mopped every other week!
