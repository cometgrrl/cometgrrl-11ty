Typical modes of transportation like cars and bicycles are boring and dull. While I love traveling, the transportation part of getting from A to B is typically annoying, complicated, and slow.

I don't mind planes, but again, B-O-R-I-N-G! Kayaks and other water transportation are fun, though. I love being on or near the ocean!

If this is transportation for fun–I'd much rather ride a flying unicorn or perhaps some of the cool transports from Harry Potter, such as brooms, flying cars, hippogriffs, and centaurs.

Today's art is a girl riding a flying unicorn, kawaii style.
