Good Reads Year in Books 2020

OMG, I passed 100 books this year! While the year isn't quite done, I expect to only add 1 or 2 more, depending on how much TV I watch between now and midnight tomorrow night.

Here's my annual list of books that stood out for me this past year. These are not the "best" books, and they were not necessarily published in 2020. These are just the books that moved me, that touched my soul in some way. Click the links to read my reviews.

In no particular order....

- _The Starless Sea_ - this one I will be reading again. I don't know what it is about this book, but I am so in love with it.
- _The Bookish Life of Nina Hill_ - Nina Hill is quirky and delightful, just like this book!
- _Fierce Fairytales: Poems and Stories to Stir Your Soul_ \- I'm a sucker for fairytales done over.
- _Know My Name_ \- such a moving memoir, and hurt my heart for Chanel and every other woman who's been a victim of sexual assault.
- _Verity_ - mystery/thriller from Colleen Hoover. I did not see that ending coming!
- _A Gentleman in Moscow_ - he's in his own sort of quarantine, watching Moscow move on around him, but without him.
- _Tiny Habits_ - possibly the best book I've ever read on habits and really inspiring me to look at how I set goals in general.
- _A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World_ - This one surprised me. The ending, but also the overall story, and the uplifting message I got from it, despite the bleak setting.
- _All the Devils are Here_ - Chief Inspector Gamache #16. If Louise Penny keeps writing these, I'm gonna keep reading them. This is probably my all-time favorite mystery series.
- _Brave Not Perfect_ - Reshma Saujani (founder of Girls Who Code) talks about why girls are different from boys. No, it's not genetics. We treat girls and boys differently, and they grow up to be different. Shockingly simple, but profound when you finally get it. Let's stop telling girls to be perfect, and start telling them to be brave instead. We could also use a dose of confidence, a dollop of bravery, and perhaps a shove out of our comfort zone.
