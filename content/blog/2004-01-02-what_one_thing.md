the friday five What one thing are you most looking forward to . . . 1. ...today? The peacefulness of having the house to myself! 2. ...over the next week? Hearing back from job opportunities in San Diego and Monterey... they were supposed to call this week, but haven't yet. 3. ...this year? Getting a sweet job and moving out of mom's house. 4. ...over the next five years? Finally figuring things out. 5. ...for the rest of your life? Finding love and happiness, and truly enjoying all that life has to offer.
