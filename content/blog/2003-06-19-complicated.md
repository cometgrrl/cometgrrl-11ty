why is life so complicated? and why the hell do things never work out for me? for instance, every time i \*really\* like someone, like recently, something always goes wrong.... yet the ones i totally don't have any interest in, they're the ones who call like border-line stalkers, calling 10 and 20 times (with no answer from me) after a 1/2 hour chat at the bar. sheesh! i think i'm gonna give up trying to figure it out. i must have done something to earn 7 years bad luck or something.
