1. **What was the last thing you purchased second-hand?** Purchased? I'm not sure -- my house??? The last thing I remember receiving second hand is a collection of tops from NY&Co courtesy of Robin.
2. **What’s a dish you cannot resist a second helping of?** Hmmm, tough question. Nachos? I will eat allllllll the nachos you can put in front of me. And then maybe go find some more.
3. **How many seconds can you go right now without blinking?** About 10, I guess.
4. **Whose second album is much better than their debut album?** New Kids on the Block. :)
5. **What’s something for which you were runner-up?** These are hard this week. Let's see I was runner-up for valedictorian of my 8th grade class. And even for that, I was sort of runner-up as I was "co-salutatorian".

Brought to you by Friday 5.
