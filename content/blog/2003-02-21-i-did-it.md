the friday five

1. What is your most prized material possession?  
    My car
2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  
    pjs that Christina gave me in high school, or maybe some tapes like Candyman. =)  
    UPDATE: I think at mom's house, I still have a teddy bear that was given to me in the hospital when I was born. That is, unless the dog ate it. (which I vaguely remember might have happened)
3. Are you a packrat?  
    Sometimes
4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  
    Clutter is good. Cleaning is bad.
5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  
    Blue, Tigers, Unicornsâ€¦ everywhere!
