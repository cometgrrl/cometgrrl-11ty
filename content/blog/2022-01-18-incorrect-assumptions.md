What do people incorrectly assume about me?

When I was in college and lived in Maryland, for some reason, people thought I was from the south. I guess they felt I had a southern accent, rather than a Californian accent? People also assumed everywhere in California was close to LA (but that's not really an assumption about me).

It's not as true as it used to be, but people often assume I'm a lot younger than I actually am.

January 9th's #Bloganuary prompt is about incorrect assumptions.
