_Safe Haven_ by Nicholas Sparks

My rating:  4 / 5

I don't read a lot of chick lit.  Well, less than 5 books per year?  And since I usually read 50-75 books per year, I'd say that's not a lot, right?  And I've never read a Nicholas Sparks novel before.  After seeing _The Last Song_ on a flight to Romania a few years ago, I started watching his movies.  I think mainly I've been watching on them on airplanes, and really, what else do I have to do for 12 hours on a plane?  For some reason, even though I don't read a lot of chit lit novels, I LOVE chick flicks.  And so far, I have really enjoyed each of the Nicholas Sparks movies I have seen, with _The Last Song_ being my favorite (c'mon, it's got singing, so of course I love it!).  Based on how well I liked the movies, I thought I'd try out one of the books.

From what I've read, this book (and the recently released movie, which I have not seen yet) is not your typical Nicholas Sparks story.  There is an element of danger in this novel and it deals with somewhat deeper topics than I'd expect in your typical chick lit, and I think, overall, it was really well done.  As for the story, I don't want to give anything away -- so go read it!   :)
