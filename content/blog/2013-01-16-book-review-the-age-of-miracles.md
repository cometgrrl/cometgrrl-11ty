_The Age Of Miracles_ by Karen Thompson Walker

My rating: 3 / 5

The Age Of Miracles is a good book. It's just not a great book. The story is told from the eyes of Julia, now an adult, recalling her life when she was 11, and the earth started slowing. Suddenly, days were 24 hours and 30 minutes long. And getting longer each night.

I was interested in both the young adult coming of age story, and the science fiction aspect. However, I felt there was too little of both. There's hardly any science, and the voice of Julia doesn't ring true. Julia doesn't feel or sound 11, she feels twenty-something, and that made it hard to relate to her. She's telling stories about being 11, but she's telling them as an adult, and I think that lost a lot of the depth of her character.

Everything seemed very flat, very slow, and I was waiting for the miracles that never happened.
