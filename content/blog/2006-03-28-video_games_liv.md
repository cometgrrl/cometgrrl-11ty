On Friday, Justin and I went with some friends to see Video Games Live at the San Jose Civic Center. I have to say, I think we were all a bit disappointed. If you were thinking about going, Justin and Matt both agree that the Final Fantasy Concert tour was MUCH better. (I can't comment on that, as I haven't been.) Speaking of Final Fantasy, Justin has gotten me addicted to FFXI online. Just when I was starting to play World of Warcraft again, too. Unfortunately, there are just not enough hours in the day to play both! I'm so addicted, I even have FFXI _goals_. These are only short term goals, for ohhh the next 2 weeks:- Get Chocobo license
- Level subjob WHM to 20
- Finish Stamp Hunt quest, and Sarutabaruta supplies quest
- Obtain Bastok Fame level 2
- Obtain cooking skill level 20
- Obtain fishing skill level 10
- Level BLM to 25 Wish me luck!!
