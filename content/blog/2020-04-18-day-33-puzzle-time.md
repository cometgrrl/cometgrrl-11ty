One of my projects during quarantine has been this puzzle. I officially started on March 28th.

I'm really starting to hate this puzzle. I'm looking for that purple piece, you know, the one that's PURPLE LIKE ALL 900 of the OTHER PIECES LEFT??!

The positive news is that the puzzle TOTALLY MATCHES THE NEW BLOG THEME! Isn't that great? ðŸ˜‚

Check back with me in 3 weeks (or maybe 3 years?), and I'll let you know if the damn puzzle is done yet or not.
