Justin and I are in London for Christmas!! It's been totally awesome and so much fun so far! We went shopping at Harrod's today and then had dinner at Levant, a very cool middle eastern restaurant complete with shisha and belly dancers! In few days, we're off to France to go snowboarding in Chamonix! Hopefully I'll have some pictures to post soon, but the camera battery is dead at the moment...
