I've done a poor job of blogging lately. I have lots of updates!

After the scary chest pain during my 1/2 marathon, I went to the doctor. My EKG was perfectly normal, and I've been running fine since then. Doc thinks it was likely costochondritis, which as it turns out, I have had before! Now think I will be able to tell the difference in the future for sure, I didn't think it was my heart, but always better safe than sorry.

I'm running a 10k in less than 2 weeks.... I'm feeling unprepared for the distance (as per my usual!) but I have run 2 minutes per mile faster this month than usual, and that's mostly easy runs, so I'm psyched! I will have to post about what I've done and what I think is helping.

I have some good books to review too, so check back later for that too.

PS. Pineapple + Basil makes a really tasty smoothie.
