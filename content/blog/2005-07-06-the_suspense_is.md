KILLING ME! I've been waiting now, for an ENTIRE week, for a phone call that could possibly contain life-changing news. If it's bad news, perhaps I really don't want to get the phone call, but at least then my torment of wondering and waiting would be over. Don't they understand that this is quite possibly more nerve racking than the actual interview process?
