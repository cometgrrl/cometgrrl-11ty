The Friday Five There's no F5 again this week, so I've decided to just randomly pick one that I never answered. 1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)? Houston, but I'm a Californian girl at heart. 2. What is your favorite number? I don't have a favorite number. What exactly is the purpose of a favorite number anyway? I've never understood that. 3. Vanilla or chocolate? I like both, but tend to dislike things that are overly chocolate. 4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in? It depends. Some times I'm in the best sellers section, the literature section, the poetry section, sci-fi, horror, computer books.... let's make this easy, let's talk about what section you won't find me in... the history section! I was just at the bookstore on Friday, picked up three good books. Finished the first one, Syrup by Max Barry, over the weekend. It was quite funny and entertaining. I'll have to write up a little review when I get a chance. 5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water? I have no idea. It's a daybed, it's been in my room since the early 80s. When I had my own bed, I had medium mattress, not too firm, not too soft. No idea what brand, I just bought whatever was on sale at the time!
