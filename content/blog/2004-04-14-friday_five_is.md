Friday Five Finally, last week's questions. =) 1. What do you do for a living? Quality assurance! 2. What do you like most about your job? I'm good at it. It would be horrible to not be good at it, I prefer to do things in areas where I can excel. 3. What do you like least about your job? It's not very challenging. At least not yet. I've only been here just under 2 months. 4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because \_\_\_\_\_... I'm tired, or I don't have enough to do. Sometimes it's because of the people I work with. 5. What other career(s) are you interested in? I'm planning on taking a chemistry class this fall, the first of 10 or 16 classes I'd like to take so that I can apply for graduate school. Right now I'm considering the Microbiology and Molecular Genetics program at UC Irvine. After general chemistry, then I'll be taking organic chemistry, biochem, cell bio, genetics, physics, and physical chemistry. If I'm doing well, I might try to apply to grad school without the physics and the physical chem.
