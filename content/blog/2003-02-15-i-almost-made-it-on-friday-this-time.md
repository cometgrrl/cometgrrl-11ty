the friday five

**Explain why you started to journal/blog.**

Because I sucked at keeping a diary. This seemed cooler =)

**Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?**

Umm, I think about one person reads it.

**Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?**

Yes, please see the description.

**What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?**

Whatever and wherever it goes will be an adventure, just like the title says.

**Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.**

I'm not a pimp.
