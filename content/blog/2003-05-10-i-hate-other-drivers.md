… ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HIT MY CAR!

Ok I was having such a good day… and then everything went to hell.

I was supposed to go downtown to a club with some co-workers. I was supposed to be riding down with a co-worker, he was supposed to call me between 10 and 10:30 and we were going to leave at that time. Called him at 9:30 to check, again at 10:30. Finally get a phone call at 10:45 -- he's an hour away, did I want to meet him there or wait (why at 9:30 when he was an hour away it didn't occur "gee, i'm an hour away and not leaving yet, i should call her" well I don't know. I said I'd wait because I didn't want to drive down alone. So… Steph calls and begs me to come right away and not wait because it's already 11.

I'm driving in downtown Baltimore, I'm in the left lane of a one way multilane street. The light is green, my lane is NOT a turn only lane, when some JERK tries to turn left and turns and hits me! I'm ok… whew. But my car isn't.

Needless to say, I was a little shaken up and my car stalled and I'm blocking an intersection. Before I could get my car started, the ass who hit me rolls down his window and says that it's just a little scratch and can't we just forget it. I said no, not until I get out and look at it. As soon as I start my car and pull over, he's driving down the road! Fortunately he was only going to a side street to find a better place to pull over.

He kept insisting that it wasn't his fault, he had a signal and he had his turn indicator on. He was foreign, Indian I believe. I tried to explain that you can't turn left from a lane in the MIDDLE but he says that I "came out of nowhere" from his blind spot. Asks me again to just forget it, claims his car is new too and that we could just each pay for our own car. Well the WHOLE SIDE of my civic is damaged and only the corner of his fender is scratched a little. NO WAY JOSE. Then he offers to write me a check. Yeah right, like he wouldn't cancel it. Plus I don't know how much it will cost to fix my car. I insist on his car insurance info and he doesn't want to give it until I tell him I'm calling the police if he doesn't and I'll let them handle it.

He finally gives me the insurance info, but takes the paper away before I can write down his name or address. I have him my license but couldn't find my insurance card. Then Steph shows up… thank god! I wasn't handling this well on my own. She pulls out a little card that tells you what info to ask for, and I get his license, name, address, etc. He still wants my insurance info, and I repeat that I don't have it with me and that he or his insurance company can contact progressive with my name and driver's license number and they will be able to access my policy. I don't think he realized that since I have his info, my insurance will file a claim with his and they'll get my damn policy number that way.

After that the night was going pretty well and I actually had a good time. Until I came home and Comet is limping and his poor little leg looks like it really hurts him.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the only witness to the accident was a man who gave me a telephone number and address (against the wishes of the ASS who hit me) … haha then the witness wanted $20 to buy food for his kids… for "helping me"…. UGH!.

I BETTER NOT BE FOUND AT FAULT. Insurance companies always screw me… every accident, whoever hits me always has a passenger, and I never do. At least a passenger would be one person to corroborate my side of the accident.

I'm going to bed now, the insurance company is calling sometime before noon to come look at my car.
