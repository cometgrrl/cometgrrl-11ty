This is an interesting prompt for me. The answer to the question "Has a book changed your life?" is clearly yes. The interesting parts lie in what books, and how.

In high school, my English teacher gave me _Watership Down_ and _The Sound and The Fury_ to read for book reports. I loved the former, it's one of my all-time favorite books, and I was not too fond of the latter. However, both deepened my appreciation for the English language and literature–both capital L Literature and regular old literature.

The most recently impactful book would have to be Adam Grant's _Think Again_. I was going through a rough time at my job, and I was in the process of interviewing for my now-current job with Automattic. This book gave me the courage to re-think my situation and to make the bold leap to leave a company I'd been with for 15 years.

A book in progress that I feel will be highly impactful when I finish and put it into practice is _Dare to Lead_ by Brené Brown. I'll be sharing a review with my thoughts on this one soon.

Other impactful books are the books that inspired my Four Pillars of Health series:

- _The Case Against Sugar_

- _Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain_

- _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_

- _Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art_

Also, I feel that any book well read changes me. As I read, I absorb a little bit of it, and I may change in myriad ways. I learn, and I become curious about new and different topics.

And lastly, I would be remiss not to mention _The Animal Manifesto,_ which is partly responsible for my decision to become a vegetarian.
