20 Books of Summer

I decided to play along and challenge myself to read 20 21 books this summer.

The pandemic may be almost over, but my vacation plans suffered (no Scotland this year), so I will have some reading time while I relax with the puppies at a nearby beach house. Hopefully, that time will help me achieve this ambitious goal!

We'll see if I can do it!

In no particular order:

1. Think Again by Adam Grant (yes, I just finished it, but it was during summer, so it counts, right?)
2. The Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up
3. The Light of All That Falls (Licanius Trilogy, book 3)
4. The Assassin's Blade
5. The Manager's Path
6. Making Work Visible
7. Testing in DevOps
8. The Guest List
9. The Last Thing He Told Me
10. Steal Like an Artist
11. Team Topologies
12. The Ickabog
13. The Pull of the Stars
14. The Queen's Gambit
15. Viva Durant and the Secret of the Silver Buttons
16. Aristotle for Everybody
17. Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe
18. Indistractable
19. The Only Good Indians
20. The Malevolent Volume
21. The Stand (time for a re-read, all 1348 pages... I reserve the right to swap in a different book!)

PS. Yes, I'm using this opportunity to dig into a lot of work related books I've been ignoring on the TBR shelf.

_What books are you reading this summer?_

PPS. Reading the challenge again, I see that it's June 1 to September 1. So, I'm going to give myself a starting credit of 3, for "Think Again", "The History of Video Games", and "Dragonflight", all of which I started and completed this month. I am not counting "Uncanny Valley" (started May 31) or "The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires" (also started in May).
