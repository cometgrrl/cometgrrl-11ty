It seems like 2015 is going to be an interesting year for me. It seems like everything is changing all at once, and yet some things are all just as they've always been.

I recently moved, and living in a new area is kind of fun. It's pretty much the same distance to work, but it's a new commute, and learning which roads are better and when is interesting. Whole Foods is super close by, so I definitely don't need to worry about groceries.

The puppies really seem to like the new house. It's familiar enough with all the same furniture, but the yard is a LOT bigger, and that's a lot of fun for them. We actually have enough room to set-up all our agility equipment at the same time now!

Since 2013, I've written here each year what my goals are and what my progress is throughout the year. This year, I don't think I'm going to do that. My life is going to be really different this year, and while I'm not sure yet what exactly that means, or what's in store, I think it will be an adventure.

Rest assured, I will still be reading (classics and non-fiction still need more love, but I read 68 books in total last year), running (Capitola 1/2 marathon in May), and working on my Spanish. :) Like I said, some things are just not changing.

Coming soon -- some recipes and something about running or maybe yoga!

What's 2015 looking like for all of you?
