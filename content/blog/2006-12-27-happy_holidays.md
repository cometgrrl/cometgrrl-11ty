So, this year, Justin's family gathered in Ottawa for Christmas. After being tormented about how I would freeze in minus 40 degree weather, we arrived to NO SNOW! We did see a few inches the day after Christmas but unfortunately, no white Christmas for us. I hope everyone else is having a happy and warm holiday!!
