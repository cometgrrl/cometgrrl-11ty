I don't know that I have one favorite meal.

Some might say it's nachos, which I am known to order any time they are present on the menu.

When I cook, it's usually tofu, salad, soup, or a smoothie.

Here are some recent and long-time favorites.

Thai Carrot and Sweet Potato soup (shown in featured image)

Plant-Based Nachos

Spicy Tofu Salad

Green Smoothie (kale, grapes, orange, banana, coconut milk, flax seeds, cayenne pepper)

African Peanut Soup

And lastly, how to make a salad that’s not boring.
