Wow. Quarantine life. It was supposed to be 3 weeks! And in a few days, it will be a full year more than that.

I've been meaning to write more, but when every day is blurs-day, and I don't go ANYWHERE, there's not a lot of exciting stuff to write about. Or is there? I actually think there's plenty to write about, I just need to make time and prioritize it.

So, this is going to be the month of writing more again.

See you soon!

xoxo
