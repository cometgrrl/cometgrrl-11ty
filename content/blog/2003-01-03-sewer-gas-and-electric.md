Bailey has been rather well behaved this evening. An odd surprise. On another note, I'm off to bed. I'm reading Sewer, Gas, and Electric, by Matt Ruff. It's a little weird so far, but by no means does it compare with the weirdness of A Clockwork Orange, which is the last novel I read. Now that Christmas has come and gone, I have a whole new stack of books to read. In addition to the books I bought myself and haven't read yet, I now have From a Buick 8 (S. King, my fav of course), Fountain Head, Treasure Island, and 1984. Wish me luck, I'll be reading until June. =) ---- not that there is anything wrong with that at all.
