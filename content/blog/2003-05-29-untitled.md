His voice was a soft whisper,  
like the sound of skin on satin sheets.  
Closed eyes, sly smile,  
she's dreaming of a lover,  
a soul mate who completes her.  
Laughing at his jokes,  
basking in the glow of her new found love,  
she turns slightly in her sleep, almost waking.  
A squeeze of the pillow, a tug on the covers,  
murmuring slightly, she drifts back into a deep sleep,  
still unaware it's just a dream.
