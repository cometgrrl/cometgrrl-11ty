I recently discovered The Healthy Apple and couldn't wait to try some of the recipes.  So, as a treat this weekend, I made brunch for my husband.  Here's a photo:

And here's the recipe.  The only modification I made was to substitute agave for the stevia since that's what I had on hand.

When I make it again, I think it needs to cook longer (and I need to use a smaller pan).  Some of the apple pieces had a nice tender, apple pie yumminess, but a lot of the pieces were still hard and kinda crispy.  I might also add a touch more OJ and/or some coconut oil.

Enjoy!
