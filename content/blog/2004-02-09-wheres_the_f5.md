So everyone wants to know where my Friday Five is this week. Hasn't anyone noticed that I rarely actually do this on Fridays? the friday five 1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done? Got a tattoo. =) 2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of? I'm not sure if I have an answer for this. Prior to getting my tattoo, that would have been the perfect answer for this question. I'll have to think of something new to do before I can answer this one. 3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) Give me a 5 please. Daring, but not THAT daring. 4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? I'm still waiting to see. The outcome has yet to be determined, but hopefully it will pay off soon. Otherwise, it will be filed under "worst outcome" in the following question. 5. ... and what's the worst? Blonde hair just didn't work for me. Now, if I went had a professional color it, I think it might actually look decent. My naturally brown hair just wasn't meant for that blonde in a box stuff they sell at Target. Nothing horrible happened, I just had weird hair for a while. And almost a year later (and several colorings later) my hair looks just fine. For the first time in a long, long time, I think it might actually go back to being it's natural color.
