From Friday 5:

1. In what way have you recently been naughty? _I'm slacking on diet and exercise while in quarantine. I've given myself a pass on energy drinks, alcohol and chips._
2. What’s the closest you’ve been to death-defying these past few weeks? _uhh, nothing reallly?_
3. What temptations have you recently resisted? _at this point, I am giving in to temptation more often than not._
4. What’s something you wish you didn’t recently see? _Trump and his daily press conferences. I've stopped watching, I just CAN'T anymore._
5. What behavior from others are you excusing nowadays? _Pretty much anything, some people need space, some people need to talk more... anything is OK except coming iinto my space and disrespecting my "social distance"_ of 6 feet.
