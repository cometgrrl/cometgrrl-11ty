Drama.... In case I haven't mentioned it before, I hate drama. It some how always manages to find me though. There used to be a joke about how my life was like a soap opera. I was going to bitch about gossip, and I've decided against it. What I really need to say is that I owe someone an apology. I'm sorry for getting them involved in my drama and causing them to be uncomfortable. You know I love ya! Now that I've officially had my chance to bitch, it's over and I will never mention it again... except to say _if I wanted someone to know something I'd tell them myself._ =)
