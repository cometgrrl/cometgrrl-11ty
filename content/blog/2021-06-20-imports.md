Introducing my first blog post!

> https://cometgrrl.com/my-latest-addiction/

I decided to finally import all my blog posts from my original blog. I used to use Moveable Type and I had some issues importing when I moved to WordPress and I never imported them. All I have is a plain text file and all the importer plugins want a CSV or XML formatting.

So, here I am, putting them in one by one. If I was really motivated, I would look at writing some php to transform it into an importable format. Alas, my php skills are not that great, and I think that would actually take longer.

Anyway, this is why you'll see a lot of posts from 2002 and such popping up here. Enjoy!

PS. I am trying not to censor myself too much :)
