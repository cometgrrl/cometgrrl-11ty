Some people miss that I was counting off the days with my quarantine posts.

The count for those started on 3/16/2020, even though that was not the date of the first post. However, I arrived home from my vacation in NZ on 3/15. Life has been different since then.

On the left, you'll now see a quarantine counter! I put the start date at 3/15. And it puts today at 113, which gives us the same count as starting with 1 on 3/16. To simplify, I formatted it to months, weeks, days. Hopefully this will be over before it gets to years!!!
