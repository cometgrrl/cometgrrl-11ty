It's been a month now, and my knee still hurts.  :(

At this point, I can run for about 30 minutes at an easy pace, and it's ok, but anything more than that, and it gets really painful. I do have to ice it immediately after, or even walking will hurt. I've been taking ibuprofen and trying to keep it easy on the high impact exercises. I only ran 14 miles in May, compared to my monthly usual of 30-40 miles.

It's probably ITBS based on my self diagnosis. I've done some IT band stretches (I should do them every day, but I'm averaging something like 2x week), and that hasn't seemed to help much.  It is better than it was when it started a month ago, but it's certainly not healed.

My doctor told me it was a "meniscus strain" and that I should take ibuprofen for 3 days (normally 7, but I had already been taking it). Oh, and come back and see someone in ortho if I have more symptoms of meniscus issues. Um... but I don't have ANY symptoms of a meniscus issue, and LOTS and LOTS of symptoms of ITBS.  (See here:  http://saveyourself.ca/articles/diagnose-runners-knee.php)

Going to see a podiatrist on Tuesday. Great guy, he did my foot surgery in 2008 when I broke my talus bone and needed 3 screws. I think I need orthotics for running, but we'll see what he says. He might have some ideas about the knee or can at least get me into see ortho quicker.

As much as I have to drag myself out of bed or out the door to go running, I really do enjoy it and I'm really sick of being prevented from running! The only good news is that I've been trying to make up for it by doing more yoga.  :)
