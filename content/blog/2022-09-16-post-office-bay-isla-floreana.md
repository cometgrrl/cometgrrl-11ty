Wednesday afternoon, we went kayaking and took a trip to Post Office Bay.

My videos of the Gal√°pagos green sea turtles won‚Äôt upload, so I will post them when I get home next week.

Post Office Bay is one of the oldest traditions on the Gal√°pagos Islands. Dating back to whaling times, the whalers would stop at Isla Floreana, and visit Post Office Bay. If they found anything at the ‚Äúpost office‚Äù near where they‚Äôd be heading, they‚Äôd take it and hand carry the letters to the recipients. This tradition continues today. Visitors look for letters addressed near their homes, and take them with a promise to hand deliver them. Visitors may also leave a letter or postcard in the barrel, hoping that a future visitor will deliver it.
