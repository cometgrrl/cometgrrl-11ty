Today was Onesie Wednesday (aka PJ day) at work. I won't be posting any photos of my outfit, even though the frog onesie is very cute, it's not a flattering look.

Instead, here's Indy and Roxy in their matching PJs. They definitely don't like wearing their PJs, and they did NOT want to pose for this pic. But we don't always get what we want, do we? :)

Did anyone else see the news that Walmart says tops are selling like hotcakes but no one is buying bottoms (pants)? This is what our world is coming to, we're becoming a society of couch potatoes who don't even put on pants!
