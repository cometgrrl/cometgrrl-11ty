Reusing my f\*ck you cancer image from last month for this one.

I'm not sure it's a gift, per se, but it's the most important recently.

Someone I love was recently diagnosed with cancer, and thankfully, they have been declared cancer-free after surgery. The fight is not over yet, as they are undergoing a very long and painful recovery from surgery.

I'd write more, but I don't want to cry.

Todayâ€™s #Bloganuary prompt: **What is the most memorable gift you have received?**
