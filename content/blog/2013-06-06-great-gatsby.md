My rating: 3 / 5

This is one of those books, that for whatever reason, is considered a classic. _An American Classic._ WHY?

Why do teenagers across the country suffer through reading this in high school? I had to read this in school, and to be honest, it was a lot like _The Scarlet Letter._ I just wasn't old enough, or mature enough, and didn't have enough life experience (Thank GOD!) to understand or appreciate the subject matter.

Now, roughly 20 years later, I actually understand this book. Back in high school, I would have summarized the novel as "some creepy guy who likes to throw parties and has a thing for the girl next door." I guess that's somewhat accurate, but really misses the point.

_The Great Gatsby_ is actually about a guy who throws parties, but not because he _likes_ parties. The purpose of the parties is to get a girl, Daisy, back in his life. Turns out, she's his new neighbor's cousin, and an introduction of sorts is in order.

To be honest, I can't really say that I liked or enjoyed this novel any more now than I did 20 years ago. I just understand the themes and concepts. Back then, I don't think I understood, really, the meaning of adultery, or how awful almost all the characters in this book turn out to be.

We went to see the movie, and the movie is entertaining, sort of. I really loved the special effects. The CGI of New York City circa 1920 was amazing. My husband liked the movie because he likes Carey Mulligan. I didn't think she was particularly inspiring in this movie, nor was anyone else, except perhaps Leonardo.  He's come along way since _Growing Pains._

Anyway, after having read this twice AND seen the movie, I've had enough!
