1. **When were you last onstage, literally or figuratively?** High school. I'm trying to remember which play was the last one -- maybe 7 Brides for 7 Brothers?
2. **Beginning with the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, what would you name the different personal stages youâ€™ve been through to today?** 1 - vacation anxiety, 2 - flying on plane anxiety, 3 - grocery shopping anxiety, 4 - everything is online, let's spend money, wheeeee....
3. **When did you unintentionally upstage someone, or when did someone unintentionally upstage you?** I probably do this unintentionally all the time. Sometimes I am not always as aware of others as I could be.
4. **How or when do you experience stage fright?** Yes, I hate public speaking. My boss makes me do it all the time, and rightfully so, it's part of my job, still hate it!
5. **What are you in the early stages of, and what are you the late stages of?** I am in the early stages of kitten fostering. The babies have been here for 5 days. I am lso in the early stages of writing a short story, but it's just an exercise and probably will not be shared WITH ANYONE! Late stages -- I'm not sure, I tend to start projects and not finish them. Oh! The bathroom remodel. Just a few finishing touches left.....

Brought you to by Friday 5.
