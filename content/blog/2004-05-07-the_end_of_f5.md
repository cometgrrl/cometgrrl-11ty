The Friday Five is no more! The owner has given up hope and left us all to suffer on Fridays (or whatever day we happened to get around to it). I guess I will just have to start coming up with my own material and my own ideas of what to write. So everyone knows how much I \*love\* my wireless keyboard and my wireless optical mouse, right? Sometimes I don't know how I'd get by without them. Well, Logitech has come out with something BETTER. They've added a portable media remote which can present email notifications (you know me, I need that!), a charging station for the mouse which also doubles as a hub. In addition to all that, it's bluetooth enabled, which means no more crappy RF receivers on the floor. Check it out at www.logitech.com. If I have to stay in the IT industry, can I please go work somewhere cool like Logitech or Google?? It's Friday. Finally. Unfortunately, that means we are getting closer and closer to some deadlines here at work. I have a feeling there are more 80 hour work-weeks in my future. The only good thing is the money. If I work another 80 week, then I won't feel guilty buying that expensive stuff for my computer.
