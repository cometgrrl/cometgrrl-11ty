_The Beggar King: A Hangman's Daughter Tale_  by Oliver Pötzsch

My rating:  4.5 / 5

_The Beggar King_ is the third installment in the Hangman's Daughter series.  The series features a hangman, or executioner, as one of the three main characters.  Set in mid-17th century Bavaria, these novels combine the mystery of a detective thriller with well-researched historical fiction.

The hangman, Jacob Kuisl, is the predominant lead character in the first of the series.  As the series progresses, the hangman's daughter, Magdalena, and Simon, the town medicus (physician), join him at the forefront.

These novels aren't for everyone.  If you don't like detective or mystery novels, you probably won't enjoy these.  Likewise if you aren't into historical fiction.  However, if a good well-written story and interesting characters is all you need, then you just might love this series.  I found that I enjoyed each subsequent novel more than the previous, mainly because the characters become more and more developed and the mysteries seemed to get more interesting.
