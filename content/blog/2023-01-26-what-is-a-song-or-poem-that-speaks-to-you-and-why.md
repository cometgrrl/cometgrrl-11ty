> **Darkness**  
> A troubled soul cries out,   
> lost amidst the darkness.   
>   
> The night sky is dark,   
> darker than any before.   
>   
> The stars shine brighter,   
> to light the way,   
> as the night grows on.   
>   
> Lost souls gazing at the horizon,   
> the darkness gives way to dawn,   
> and the stars fade away.

This is today's #Bloganuary entry. This poem was originally published here.

Today's art comes from a request to Dall•E to make something to go with the poem.
