As you may know, I often take in foster dogs as a volunteer with a local dog rescue (Jake's Wish). In October of last year, I picked up Tessa from the shelter, and just fell in love with her. If I didn't already have 2 of my own, I'm sure I would have adopted her. Then, in November, I was presented with an opportunity to save a Maltese mix from certain death at the Long Beach Shelter (she had less than 24 hours left at the shelter when I found out about her). With the help of many others and my rescue's support, Angel was saved and relocated to the Bay Area to stay with me.

This was the first time I'd ever had 2 foster dogs at the same time. I have to say, fostering is highly rewarding, but having 4 dogs all at the same time showed me that 3 dogs is really my limit, and that if I want to continue fostering, that means having only 2 of my own. And after moving last month, I am not allowed to have 4 dogs anymore. Sadly, Tessa had to go to another foster home, but Angel was able to stay with me. 

All my foster dogs have a special place in my heart, but I think Angel and Tessa will always be extra special. Angel was really the first case where it was clear _this dog will die if I don't do something immediately._ And with Tessa, well, she fit in so well at my house. I am amazed that it took as long as it did for both these cuties to find their homes!

Tessa came to me shortly after having a leg amputated, and she needed a few trips to the vet to get her stitches and staples removed before she was ready for adoption. At adoption events, we had lots of people interested in hearing Tessa's stories, but no one who was seriously interested in adopting her. She also was not getting any applications submitted online. A few weeks ago, Tessa finally found her match and went to her forever home. I think it may have been even harder for her second foster family to say goodbye than it was for me.

Angel allegedly had a lot of medical issues.  Turns out she has skin allergies which caused her ear infection, and she had a UTI that was very treatable. A few vet visits for her and some allergy meds every day, and our little Angel was ready to find her forever home.

With Angel, we had a couple of potentials that said they were serious, only to change their minds at the last minute. "Oh, we want a younger dog". You know, that's really fine, but Angel's age was known in advance and it's annoying to support or coordinate a special meeting for a potential to have them not adopt. This was the second time we'd made special arrangements for a potential adopter to meet Angel.

When I rescued Angel, I knew that because of her possible medical issues and her age (7-10 years), that she could be hard to place in the right home. She is a super sweetie, a little couch potato. However, she also has allergies and because of that she has thinning fur/hair and her tail is practically hairless!

During the time that Angel was with me, she has gone to doggie day care along with my dogs. And, as it turns out, one of the wonderful employees fell in love with my little Angel and adopted her this past weekend. :)

So now all my foster babies have been adopted, and it's back to just Indy and Roxy. And that's ok. We'll foster again in the future!

We are all very happy to see Tessa and Angel in their forever homes, but that doesn't mean we don't miss them!
