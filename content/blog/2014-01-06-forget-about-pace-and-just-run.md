I recently came across this article online "Focus On The Right Metrics" over at runnersconnect.net. The main focus of the article is that runners shouldn't focus on the pace of their easy runs, and should instead focus on "executing the purpose of the workout and completing it to the best of your ability."

I've never really thought about it much before, and now I can't stop thinking about it. Do I obsess over the pace of my easy runs? Do I consider myself better/faster/fitter if I'm running my easy runs faster? Am I actually better/faster/fitter if I'm running my easy runs (but not my other training workouts) faster?

You know what? I think I DO think of myself as faster if I'm doing my easy runs faster. Yet, I can't do the tempo runs or the sprints any faster. The author of the article kindly points out that running the easy runs faster is NOT actually better for training. In fact, running them too fast is probably BAD for training, because the purpose of the easy runs is for recovery and if I am pushing it too much, then I'm not recovering, right?

I'm sort of obsessed with my pace and all stats. I run often on the treadmill at home, and I can't keep my eyes off the time/distance for more than 10-15 seconds. Even when I run outside, I have my GPS app giving me my stats every minute. Yes, every single freaking MINUTE. Once, I actually posted a photo (below) on Instagram of my treadmill display.

I think I need to start running "naked" (this means no GPS, and yes, there will be clothes) a few times a month and just relax.

QOTD - do you worry about pace on your easy runs?  Any runs? Do you ever run "naked"?
