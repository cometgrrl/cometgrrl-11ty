Tofu with peanut sauce is one of my all time favorite dishes to make at home. This recipe is based on a lot of other recipes, stealing the bits that I like best from each.

For years, I've baked my tofu and I'm happy to say I think this recipe is an improvement, and it's also faster!

You can substitute pretty much any veggies you want in this recipe, just adjust the cooking times. Broccoli, carrots, bok choy would all work well.

Also, I think this would be delicious with a can of coconut milk and a splash of lime juice. These can be added at the end, and you can simmer a bit to reduce the sauce. If going this route, cook the veggies less, or take them out before putting the tofu back into the pan to avoid overcooking.

Ingredients

Peanut Sauce:
1 1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1/4 cup soy sauce 
1/4 cup light brown sugar 
1 tbsp sriracha (less if you're not a fan of spicy)
2 1/2 tbsp peanut butter (dark roasted, crunchy is my favorite!)

Tofu - firm or extra firm
Peanuts - 1/2 cup or more
1 can water chestnuts
Snap Peas
Oil - I use avocado oil with a dash of toasted sesame oil for the frying in this recipe

Optional:
1 can coconut milk
lime juice
cilantro

Steps:

Press the tofu.

Slice the tofu into slabs.

Add 1-2 tbsp of oil to the pan and heat it up.

Fry tofu 4-6 minutes per side until nicely browned.

While the tofu is cooking, mix all ingredients for the peanut sauce in a shallow dish.

Marinate the tofu 10 minutes (or more) per side.

Heat more oil, and cook your veggies, being careful not to overcook.

Cut or break tofu into bite size pieces. I use pizza scissors for this!

Add the tofu to the hot pan with the veggies, a spoonful of sauce, and the peanuts. 

Add coconut milk now if using (and add ALL the peanut sauce), simmer until sauce is desired consistency.

Add a splash of lime juice to taste.

Serve with rice, quinoa, or additional veggies.
