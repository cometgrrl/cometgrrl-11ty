the friday five At this moment, what is your favorite... 1. ...song? I'm in a jazzy mood tonight, so I'll go with the following 2. (sorry I can't pick just one!) "Deep Blue" by Keiko Matsui and "I Get So Lonely" by Boney James. 2. ...food? Pizza. Screw all those low carb diets, I love my pizza, my breadsticks, my potatoes, cereal, rice, etc. Sometimes I think I would die without carbs, but I suppose I could live without them, I just don't plan on that ever happening. 3. ...tv show? This is a tough one. There's so many shows I like to watch. However, since it says "at this moment" I'll go with Sex and the City, since I plan on watching this week's new episode in a few minutes. 4. ...scent? Happy by Clinque. 5. ...quote? Right at this very moment, my favorite quote is "you're hired!" ... because that's what I'm waiting to hear. Of course, if that was followed by "and we're going to pay you $100K with 5 weeks paid vacation" well that would be great too. \*\*\* I believe this is the first post with the updated look. The old black with white text was getting a little, well, _old_.... leave feedback in the comments if you like it, hate it, or find something that's not working or looks wrong.
