_![The Husband's Secret](images/17802724-198x300.jpg)The Husband's Secret_ by Liane Moriarty is one of the worst books I have read lately. I really enjoyed Moriarty's latest novel _Big Little Lies_, and I was hoping this would be more of the same. I was wrong.

The characters in this novel are so shallow and very poorly developed. The novel switches between Cecilia, Tess, and Rachel, whose lives are intertwined in unexpected ways. We hardly learn anything about the husband who has the secret, even after his secret is revealed. 

The novel opens with Cecilia finding a letter addressed to her from her husband, hidden in the attic. It says "to be opened in the event of my death", so naturally, instead of opening it, she asks him about it, and then opens it later after he asks her not to.

The three women in this novel are petty, selfish, and very unlikable. And they make stupid decisions that make me hate them. Actually, by the end of the book, I hated pretty much everyone in this book.

Rubbish! The whole thing was rubbish, and I think Tess's part of the story could have been cut completely, and it wouldn't have mattered. Of course, it would be better to just cut all.
