_Mirrored Heavens_ is the fabulous conclusion to the Between Earth and Sky trilogy by Rebecca Roanhorse.

With fantastic world building, magic, and intrigue, the Between Earth and Sky trilogy is on par with some of my other favorite fantasy series, such as the Broken Earth, and Inheritance trilogies by N.K. Jemisin.

Naranpa, avatar of the Sun God, and Serapio, the Crow God Reborn, both seek to save their people. They each face their own enemies, as we traverse the lands of Meridian, from the depths of the wastelangs, to Tova where the sun no longer shines, and the island of Teek, where the all-female islanders' magic is fading.

At over 600 pages, it's another long one, as are the first two books in the trilogy. However, I can't recommend this enough! I loved the whole series, with its unique take on mythology, legends, magic, and the place of gods among us.

★★★★
