I hate chores. They are so mundane and boring.

Most challenging? Can I say ALL of them?

I don't particularly enjoy doing the dishes. I have tried to motivate myself and set a standard that dishes get washed or put in the dish washer immediately, and I will do alright with this for a few days or maybe even a week. Until. Until the dishwasher is full. Until I do some fancy cooking and get 8390483 things dirty.

I'm also not a fan of cleaning up animal poop. The Litter Robot automated litter box is worth every penny. There's still the dogs' poop, but... we manage.

If I had three wishes, I might just use one of them to wish to never have to do chores again.
