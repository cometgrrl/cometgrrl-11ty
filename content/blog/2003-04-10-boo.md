UC San Diego Admission

Dear _loser_ \[me\],

I _don't really care_ \[regret to inform you\] that the Dean of Graduate Studies has _determined that you are too stupid_ \[not approved your application for admission\] for graduate study in the Bioinformatics Program at the University of California, San Diego. _Just to be nice, we're rejecting you twiceâ€¦ the real letter is in the mail._ \[An official letter has been mailed to your home address.\]

A number of factors _contributed our decision to reject you_ \[are considered in evaluating each applicant\] including, _the fact that you were a mediocre undergrad_ \[a student's undergraduate preparation\], _your lack of intellect_ \[scholarship average, and requisite test scores\]; _the fact that none of our professors want to work with you_ \[whether the research interests of faculty are relevant to those of the applicant\]; and _the fact that letting in someone like you would ruin the university's reputation_ \[whether an applicant can be accommodated by the department to which application is made\].

Unfortunately, it is not possible for the University to accept all that apply and each department must screen applications carefully to find the best qualified students. For this reason, _all retarded_ \[many excellent\] applicants _such as yourself_ must be denied admission.

I sincerely hope that you will be able to further your academic training at another institution _should any be willing to accept a hopeless case such as yours_.

Sincerely,

Graduate Admissions Office
