Well 2013 is almost over.  It's been quite a year!  I went way over on some of my goals, and fell short in other areas.

Here's a quick look at how I did:

Blogging - PASS. Pretty good, although I would like to be more consistent in frequency and more evenly spread across topics of running, reading, and recipes/foodie posts.

Run more miles - FAIL. Only 284 miles so far, just over 30 miles behind goal. However, I was injured AND had surgery this year, so all things considered, I think I did pretty good.

Races - PASS. I made the goal of 6 races (barely), but missed the stretch goal of 10. I missed 2 races due to my surgery, so I am pretty happy with 6.

Spanish - PASS. We completed Spanish 1 (easy goal), and 17/30 lessons from Spanish 2. I really wanted to complete Spanish 2, but David has been struggling with it, as it's getting harder and harder now. I have been studying on the side using Duolingo on my phone, and I love it!

Romanian - FAIL. I don't think I made any significant progress this year on learning Romanian. I wish Duolingo or Fluenz had Romanian!

Read the Classics - PASS. I finished Les Miserables, and The Catcher in the Rye. Anna Karenina was postponed until January as I tried to reach an additional goal this year of reading 70 books. I've also decided to skip On the Road, while Lolita will be on the list for 2014.

The additional goal of read 70 books - PASS! I'm already reading number 75 and I still have a few days left. I'd love it if I could make 80, but I'm not sure. We have a 14 hour flight to New Zealand on Saturday, so I could easily make it to 76 or 77. How does this stack up with last year? Well, last year I read only 61 books, so this is quite amazing!

Happy New Year and Happy Holidays everyone!  Check back next year for my 2014 goals!
