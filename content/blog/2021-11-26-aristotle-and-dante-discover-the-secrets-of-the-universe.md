This is another superb book I've read recently. It's not often that I read so many books that I absolutely love, so I'm feeling very fortunate in this regard.

_Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe_ by Benjamin Alire Sáenz is a modern coming-of-age story, centered around Mexican-American teenagers Aristotle and Dante. Our two main characters struggle with identity, fitting in, and learning the hard truths about life. On the surface, Ari and Dante couldn't be more different; yet as these two lonely boys form a connection, they realize they have more in common than expected.

It's always so hard to know how much of the plot I should discuss in my reviews; I hate giving away spoilers. Instead, let me talk about themes, hopefully without ruining any of the surprises of the plot. This novel is about love, kindness, anger, honesty, communication, self-acceptance, and so much more.

I had the pleasure of listening to this through Audible. As I may have said before, a good narrator can make or break an audiobook for me, and this is no exception. With Lin Manuel Miranda narrating, the story has a tender, heartbreaking quality to it.

With over 50 Audible books in my library waiting to be read/listened to, it will be a while before I can make time to listen to the second book in the series. However, it's definitely on my list for next year! I look forward to following along with Ari and Dante as they mature into young men.
