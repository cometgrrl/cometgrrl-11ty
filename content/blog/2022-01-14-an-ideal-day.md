#Bloganuary prompt for today is to write about an ideal day.

I am not a morning person. Even my genetics says I'm not a morning person. _"Brienna, people with your genetics wake up on average around **7:58 am** on their days off."_

And even that sounds early to me for a day off! Wake up at 5? HA! Anything close to an ideal day isn't going to start until at least 8 am. And it shall be sunny. Sunny and warm. But not too warm. I don't like too much humidity or sweltering heat. Let's say a nice, enjoyable 75-80 ℉

Beyond that—I'm not sure. Is this a weekend? A workday? Or should we say since it's an ideal day, clearly it's not a workday?

So... I'm sleeping in and waking up to an absolutely gorgeous, sunny, warm but not hot or humid day. What's next?

On a daily basis, I like to spend time with my furry babies—Indy, Roxy, and Dexter. I also like to read, often I do some writing as well. On days with great weather, I feel strongly like being in nature, even if that's just my hammock in my backyard.

And changing the prompt slightly from an ideal day to a perfect date, then my answer would be _"That's a tough one. I'd have to say April 25th. Because it's not too hot, not too cold, all you need is a light jacket."_
