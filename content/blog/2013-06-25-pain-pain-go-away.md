I finally got a referral to an orthopedic doctor to look at my knee. It's been bothering me since the end of April, and really hampering my training for Disney.

The good news: x-rays look awesome, nothing structurally wrong with the knee, no arthritis

The bad news: it's unclear exactly what IS wrong. It could be ITBS or it could be a tear in the meniscus, which is what my primary care doctor thought it was.

Outcome: physical therapy, stretch 5x/week, ice after stretching or running, and come back if it gets worse or doesn't get better.

I'm not super happy about this.  Granted, it hasn't been excruciatingly painful since May, and I'm able to run.  However, I do feel limited by it and anxious.  If I go outside for a long run, will I be able to make it home?  In May, I went less than .5 miles outside before calling my husband to pick me up because it hurt so much I didn't even want to try walking home, even though it was such a short distance.

The bright side is that I completed a 7.3 race pace / long run yesterday!  The downside is that I wanted it to make it 7.5 but I was worried about knee pain.  :(  It was just at that point where I knew more running would trigger pain.  .2 miles didn't seem worth the risk!

P.S. I'll have some more book reviews coming soon, and an update on the June diet extravaganza.  Just teaser -- I tried a juice fast and survived!

P.P.S. You'll notice the sidebar (over there ---> if you're on the main page)  now contains some count downs to my next races.  I'll be adding more races soon I hope!
