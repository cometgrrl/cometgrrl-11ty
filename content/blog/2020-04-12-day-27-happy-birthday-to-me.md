I'm celebrating my birthday quarantine style this year.

I received a lot of GREAT birthday gifts this year. Thank you so much for the extra effort to Robin, Dad & Nanette, Kari, and Flora for these amazing gifts.

Since I can't go anywhere, I've been celebrating here at home, with one of my most favorite people in the world, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

After enjoying some sunshine in the hammock (sporting my very cool HHGTTG shirt, because OF COURSE 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything), I made my first "People's Margarita" with The Rock's new Teremana Tequila. I have to say, it's a damn good margarita and I love that he puts pineapple in his margaritas, just like on his pizza.

I haven't decided what I"m doing with the rest of my evening yet, but since Dwayne can't actually be here in person, I may have to queue up Gridiron Gang or Fast Five.

For now, I'll settle for a second margarita!
