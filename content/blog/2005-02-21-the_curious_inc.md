the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by Mark Haddon This is not the usual type of book that I pick up to read. It's not Tom Robbins, Matt Ruff, Stephen King, Sci-fi, or Horror. That said, it was good. The story centers around a young boy, Christopher. Christopher is investigating, or as he says in the novel, "detecting", the murder of his neighbor's dog Wellington. He's not your typical 15 year-old boy though, as he knows every prime number up to 7,057 and calms himself by counting the cubes of cardinal numbers (1, 8, 27, 64, etc). It's an interesting story, very different, I think, from most of the other books on the shelves today. Overall, I thought the story was a little on the short-side and that some of the other characters in the book besides Christopher were underdeveloped. However, that may have been the intention, because it's supposed to be a book that was written by Christopher himself, and he's definitely not a people-person. He prefers math and physics to poetry and fiction, doesn't understand make-believe or why people would tell a lie. Imaging things that aren't real makes his head hurt and the last thing on earth he would like is for anyone to touch him.
