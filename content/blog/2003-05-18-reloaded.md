"The Matrix is like an onion."

I thought the movie was _very_ good. Awesome effects, good storyline to move the plot along. A lot of people have been telling me that it didn't really have much of a plot and mostly the story was just to get from the first movie to the third movie, but I think they missed a lot. There were some VERY significant developements in the storyline that I won't mention hereâ€¦ don't want to spoil it for ya'll who haven't seen it yet.

And with that, it's time for bed.
