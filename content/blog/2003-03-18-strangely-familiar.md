The last book I finished reading was _Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas_, by Tom Robbins. I really enjoyed it. It was humorous and entertaining throughout the whole novel.

Here's the odd part. About a day after I finished reading it, I had this weird feeling. Then it hit me. The characters in the book reminded me of my own life. Sure, sure, the main character Gwen was a stock broker in Seattle -- not quite me, right? Yep. But she was -- a) good looking and insecure b) hated her high pitched voice c) not secure about her job d) trying to make a relationship work with someone totally wrong for her and e) not happy with her income/financial security. HELL all that sounds like ME!

But wait… there's more! The odd similarities between Gwen and myself was the second revelation I had after reading this, not the first.

You know how sometimes you hear voices in your head? WAIT. That should say "You know how sometimes _when you're reading a book_ you can hear the voices in your head?" Well, Gwen's, umm, "romantic interest" is probably the best description, Larry Diamond, his voice in my head was the voice of my ex. And I didn't realize it until after I finished the whole book. And I said to myself "huh, that's odd" … then it hit me. He _was_ my ex.

Larry Diamond had long hair, wore a beat up leather jacket, was very intelligent, but slightly different from the normal "intellectual type". He travelled to Timbuktu, believed in beliefs of the Bozo and the Dogon. Now, my ex didn't believe those specific things or travel to Timbuktu, but he's been to other equally out-of-the-norm travel destinations. And he believes a lot of things most ordinary people don't. And he certainly matched the physical description fairly well.

Then after realizing Gwen was me and Larry was my ex, even the sexual chemistry between the two matching what my ex and I had, then I had a final revelation. Gwen's boyfriend in the book, dependable, boring Belford Dunn…. was my ex finance, the one I left before dating the ex that was Larry… which is sort of what Gwen does in the book. Altho, she comes to realize Larry isn't quite "her type" and decides to follow a path separate from both Belford and Larry. Which, come to think of it, is what I have done.

This book hit me the way _Keeping the Faith_ with Ben Stiller and Ed Norton hit me. In the "that's MY life" kinda of way. Of course, that movie wasn't exactly my life, but there were amazing parallels just like with _Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas_.

Anyway, that's all for now. I've been meaning to post this for 2 weeks. At this point, I'm almost done with my next novel -- _From a Buick 8_, by Stephen King. Totally different type of book, but still very good in its own right. Stephen King is awesome and Dreamcatcher starts this Friday!
