So, after getting hacked yesterday, I got set-up with LastPass and started changing passwords.

Did you know if you go to https://passwords.google.com/checkup/ Google will give you the status of all the passwords you have saved in the browser? Let me tell you -- it ain't pretty.

I've updated the password on all the accounts marked "compromised". For some of these, the websites didn't exist anymore, or are things I do not use. Where I could, I deleted my account. Everything now has a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious strong password, no repeats! Wooooooo hoooooo.

And I even made progress on the puzzle today too. Maybe 5 pieces? Not much, but at the rate I've been going, I'll be happy if I finish it this year.

And now, I'm off to finish S3 of Ozark. I got a little distracted on Friday watching "Never Have I Ever" on Netflix. I thought it was a movie -- turns out it's a series, with 10 ~25 minute episodes. And yes, I did watch it like it was movie, start to finish in one sitting (with some intermissions for food and bathroom). Mindy Kaling does not disappoint, except for the fact that she is no where to be seen in the series (at least in S1).
