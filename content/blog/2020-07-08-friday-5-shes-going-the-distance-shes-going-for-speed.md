It's Tuesday! You know what that means? It's time for the Friday 5! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

1. **What’s your favorite cake?** A friend once made me a vegan Samoa (girl scout cookie) ice "cream" cake for my birthday. It was ahhhhhh-mazing.
2. **When did you last have pancakes?** 2019 for my birthday. At Denny's, at like 3am? With Sachin, Robin, and Tony. I am not responsible for anything I said that night. Oh, and I still owe Sachin a milkshake.
3. **When did you last bake a cake or a cake-like thing?** I have no idea. I am not a cake baker. Oh wait, I made brownie/muffins in November. They were supposed to be sugar free (and gluten-free, corn-free, soy-free, and vegan) and they came out so terrible I threw them all away.
4. **What part of your job is a piece of cake?** Finding bugs. They find me.
5. **Where have you had a really good cupcake?** at work, I think that's the last time I had a cupcake.

**Bonus question: What are your thoughts on icing?** I'm fond of telling people that if it doesn't have icing, it's a not a cupcake. It's a muffin!

Brought you to by Friday 5.

PS. Actually, I had pancakes at IHoP in October. Not as good as the ones from Denny's.
