Tomorrow morning I'll be off to Hollywood for the weekend. Dinner at the Hollywood Bowl on Saturday, and a tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. I think I'll also check out Grauman's Chinese Theatre, since it is only half a mile from my hotel. Who knows, I might even run into someone famous. =) Maybe someone important will see me and ask me to be in a movie. Yeah right. A girl can dream, can't she?
