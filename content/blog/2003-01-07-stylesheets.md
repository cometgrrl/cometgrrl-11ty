Note from the future (2021): I skipped importing some short posts similar to this about Moveable Type and getting the blog running on my own domain.

If you happen to notice that some of the pages on my weblog just don't quite match the others, it's due to my utter lack of knowledge about stylesheets in HTML. Blogger was easy, you made one template, hardcoded everything in HTML, and voila, everything came out fine. Here I need templates for everything and they all use stylesheets.

I guess it makes sense. One place to change everything, but I don't get it. So I hard coded the main template and the archives, but now nothing else matches. And I can't deal with the default styles either…. too boring.

Maybe the next project will be learning stylesheets… haha…. unless someone wants to do it for me ;)
