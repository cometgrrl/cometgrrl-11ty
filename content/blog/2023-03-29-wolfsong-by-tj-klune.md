_Wolfsong_ by TJ Klune is a captivating novel that explores the themes of identity, love, loss, and acceptance through the eyes of Ox, a young man with a speech impediment who has always felt like an outsider in his small town. The story follows Ox as he becomes entangled in the world of werewolves and magic, and as he grows older, he realizes that his fate is tied to the fate of his pack, and he must fight to protect those he loves from the dangers that lurk in the shadows.

Overall, I enjoyed reading Wolfsong, although I felt it wasn't as strong as some of Klune's other works, such as _The House in the Cerulean Sea_ or Under the Whispering Door. That being said, the unique take on the werewolf mythology that Klune presents in this novel is refreshing, and the world-building is well-executed.

In conclusion, I would recommend Wolfsong to readers who enjoy YA and LGBTQIA+ fiction and to those who appreciate complex themes and character arcs. I want to express my gratitude to NetGalley and the publishers for providing me with a copy of the book in exchange for a fair and honest review.

★★★
