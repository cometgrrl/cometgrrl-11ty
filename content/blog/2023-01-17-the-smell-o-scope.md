I don't know if this makes me weird or unusual, but nothing comes to mind as a memory linked to smell. I've suffered from allergies most of my life, and had lots of sinus issues, so that may have had an impact here. I'm not sure!

What I do know is that this prompt made me think of the Smell-O-Scope from Futurama.

Today's art is DALL•E's best interpretation of my description of the Smell-O-Scope: `A cartoon man in a white lab coat using a giant telescope-like device. This telescope is used with your nose instead of your eyes, called a Smell-O-Scope.`

Today's #Bloganuary prompt: **Do you have a memory that’s linked to a smell?**
