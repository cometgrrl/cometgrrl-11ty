I thought my husband would like this combo, so I threw some stuff together in my Vitamix as an experiment, and wow, it was really tasty!

Here's the recipe:

**chocolate banana peanut butter coconut smoothie** serves 2

Ingredients

- 2 cups vanilla light soy milk or any non-dairy milk (even water could work, if you want cut down the calories)
- 2 scoops Vega Energizing Smoothie in Choc-a-lot flavor
- 1 Banana
- 1 generous scoop peanut butter (I used homemade peanut butter, another great thing you can make with a Vitamix!)
- 4-5 coconut water ice cubes (just freeze coconut water in your ice-cube trays to make)
- Roasted coconut flakes

Directions

- Combine all ingredients except the roasted coconut flakes in a blender, and blend until creamy and smooth.
- Pour into 2 large smoothie glasses and top with roasted coconut flakes.
