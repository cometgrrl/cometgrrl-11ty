Here are my resolutions (we'll see if I stick to them this year)

- Take the dogs to the lake at least once a month, preferably more when the weather is above 50 degrees (because we all know they need the exercise, and who knows, we might meet a hot guy with some dogs of his own while we're there)
- Housetrain the puppy ASAP
- Continue paying off the credit cards (impossible to complete this year, but I want to see significant reductions in my outstanding balances

And that's all I have. Life goes on hereâ€¦. Bailey is taking a timeout for peeing in my room. Never fails, I watch him like a hawk for hours, take him out before I eat dinner and he does it while I'm washing the dishes.
