Thanks to everyone who asked about my hand. It's a bad burn, but not as bad as it could have been I guess.

Typing is tolerable today, although still not super fun. Lots of little blisters popping up -- I swear they are reproducing!

Anyway, I'm feeling kinda of meh today. Because of the hand and thinking about another 30 days at home, not going anywhere.

I had to cancel my work trip and missed out on a side trip to Barcelona. I would have been flying home today.

I wonder when traveling for fun will be a thing people do again?

How is everyone feeling about the stay at home being extended? Are we being overly cautious at this point? There is so much conflicting info circulating, it's hard to know what's what. I guess we shall see how other states like Georgia fare.

Coming soon -- an update on my horribly frustrating purple puzzle and maybe a new book review!
