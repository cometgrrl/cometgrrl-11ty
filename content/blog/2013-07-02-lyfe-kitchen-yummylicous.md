David and I finally made it to Lyfe Kitchen in Palo Alto today for the first time. The short review is simple: it's yummylicous!

This is actually my first restaurant review. I am really excited that we finally went here, and can't wait to go back. I really wanted to try the kale-banana vegan smoothie, but since we were already getting the hummus, I didn't want to overeat!

I ordered the cucumber mint cooler in place of the smoothie, and it was very refreshing. I just had something similar at El Torito and this was much better! Lyfe Kitchen's version was more like cucumber juice and El Torito's was more of a non-alcoholic cocktail style, with sparking water and lots of added sweetness (agave).

David and I shared the edamame hummus appetizer. It was good, but this is actually the only thing I didn't love. The flax crackers were dry and not very tasty. The hummus itself was also on the bland side. I don't know that I've ever had edamame hummus before, but I think now I might have to make up my own recipe.

Next up was the tofu tacos. These were delish! The menu says these are agave-lime tofu, chayote slaw, avocado, green onion, cilantro, chipotle aioli, and salsa fresca on warm corn tortillas. The tofu was slightly grilled and very tasty. The slaw, avocado, onion, cilantro and chipotle aioli complemented the tofu and were super tasty too. The salsa was just average, and honestly, I didn't eat much of it. It came on the side, and I was 1/2 way done before I even noticed it.

David had the margherita flatbread. He said it gets a 2-thumbs up from him. He offered me some, but um, yeah, not vegan with that cheese on there!

I think I might go back tomorrow, just to get the kale-banana smoothie. :)
