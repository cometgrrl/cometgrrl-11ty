Last night, after reading until 1:30am, I finally completed Les Miserables! And that takes care of the "easy" goal for reading, but I feel this one was almost too easy, considering I finished 70% or so of the book in 2012! I will post a review shortly, probably not until later this week, after i've seen the move. I might do a combo review of the book and the movie at the same time, so stay tuned!

As for running, I think I should have made a goal to "run faster" but I think that will come with proper training.

**Today's run** distance: 4.25 miles time: 55:30 speed: 4.6 mph (yes, I am slow!)

Roxy and I ran up past the 49ers stadium construction and down the Guadalupe River Trail. Â This pic is not from today, but a recent picture from a morning run last month.
