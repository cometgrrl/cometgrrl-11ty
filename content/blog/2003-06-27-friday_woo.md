the friday five 1. How are you planning to spend the summer \[winter\]? I plan on spending the summer at pool and out playing with my dogs as much as possible. 2. What was your first summer job? I worked at the local video store. 3. If you could go anywhere this summer \[winter\], where would you go? Hmm... I would go to an island and spend all my time learning to surf... I even know someone \*wink\* who I would drag with me, if they had the time. 4. What was your worst vacation ever? My spring break in Las Vegas. My ex didn't want to go at the last minute, so I spent the week at home moping about how I wasted a lot of money on plane tickets and didn't go anywhere! 5. What was your best vacation ever? I really had a lot of fun on my last vacation, which was visiting my parents and traveling California. Catalina Island is awesome!
