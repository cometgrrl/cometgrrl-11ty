OK, so I love animated movies. But I love GOOD animated movies. The last one was Kung Fu Panda, and before that, Ratatouille. WALL-E is by far the best animated movie I've seen in a long time. It's not just an animated movie, it's a sci-fi movie. It's also a romantic comedy. It's just great. The animation is brilliant, the characters are delightful.

WALL-E, for those of you that don't know, stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth class. The same guy that created the "voice" of R2D2 also created the voice of WALL-E. At first, I thought it was a little off-putting that the main character of the movie didn't actually have a voice, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine it having been done any other way. The thing with animated movies, I think, is that they struggle to entertain both kids and adults. There are a lot of movies that fail to do one or the other or both. This is not one of those. WALL-E pulls it off brilliantly. There is enough cutesy-ness for kids, but enough substance to the story for adults. What else can I say except "Go see it!"
