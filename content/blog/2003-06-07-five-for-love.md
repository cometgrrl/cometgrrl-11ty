the friday five

1. How many times have you truly been in love?

Once, maybe twice.

2. What was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most?

He made me laugh… I think we really shared a lot in common on a fundamental level…so hard to explain love!

3. What qualities should a significant other have?

_Since someone commented on my previous answer, the following is the edited/expanded version:_

- I need someone who "gets" me
- A sense of humor, and the ability to know when to be silly and when not to. Someone who understands my humor is a plus.
- Must like animals!!
- Definitely non anti-social. I like to go out do things, anti-social in a hardcore way where being around _me_ causes them issues, I can't handle that.
- Someone who just knows when I've had a bad day and can cheer me up
- Literate… good spelling… it's a pet peeve, what can I say! And I like being around someone who I can have intelligent conversations with about more than just TV and the weather, even if we don't always have them.
- Gotta love me the way I am, flaws and all.
- Someone who would treat me right. I previously said "not make me cry" but I guess that was incorrect, because there's good crying and bad crying. Crying because I'm miserable because of the way someone treated me is not cool.

1. Have you ever broken someone's heart?

yes, I think I have. (unintentionally)

5. If there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be?

That it is largely uncontrollable and you just gotta make it work for ya.
