**What is a treasure that’s been lost?**

I'll be honest, I'm not inspired by today's #bloganuary prompt.

My snarky answer is, well, here's a list of 30 "treasures" that are lost: 30 of the World's Most Valuable Treasures That Are Still Missing. Or maybe this means the City of Atlantis?

Ok, ok. I know what they're asking is for something that I consider treasured and lost. Perhaps it's a forgotten memory (although how I'd know that's lost, I'm not sure), or a person/relationship, or maybe a lost item?

I don't find any of those interesting to write about. So let me share this story of a lost shoe (a Birkenstock no less!), instead. While it was not a treasure, it definitely was lost.

I was at The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and having a great time running around with my friend Jenny, and riding the rides, particularly the Logger's Revenge, over and over.

At one point, we went on a ride called Typhoon. (The current ride Typhoon, that's there now, is similar but not the same ride.) This is how I lost my shoe.

On the ride, Typhoon, you are in a cage that swings back and forth like a pendulum, building momentum until it finally goes all the way over. While we were briefly suspended fully upside-down at the top of the ride, my shoe came off. And it managed to fall through the cracks of the cage door. And it landed..... right on top of the center pillar of the ride.

Park employees were not willing (or able?) to go up there. So, my shoe was lost. I spent the rest of the day with only one shoe, and ran around barefoot.
