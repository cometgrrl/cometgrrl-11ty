_Gone Girl_ by Gillian Flynn

My rating: 5 / 5![](images/ir?t=cometgrrlcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=030758836X)

OMG!!! This book is crazy!  This is one of those books that's really hard to review without giving anything away.

Basically, seemingly normal guy, Nick, comes home to find seemingly normal wife, Amy, gone.  Missing.  Kidnapped?

And then we learn that they are not normal.

This book is not too overly graphical, considering it could be classified as a murder mystery.  However, the characters are indeed sick, and very, very twisted.  I really enjoyed the whole thing!
