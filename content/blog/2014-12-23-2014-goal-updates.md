Turns out I've done a so-so job of hitting my goals this year.

Run 300 miles?  Check.  @ 302 this week.

Run 6-10 races? FAIL. I ran two. And I paid for 4 that I skipped.  BOO.

Yoga? Check and FAIL I started. And then I stopped. And I started again. And I stopped again. I need to work on this one because my back has been bothering me lately.

Finish Fluenz Spanish 2 and 3? Yes and No. I finished level 2, and I'm working on level 3 right now. I can probably be 1/4 of the way done by the end of the year.

Focus on weight loss but don't obsess? FAIL. I'm up 4 lbs for this year. The only good news is that a few months ago that was closer to 10 lbs up.

Music theory?  FAIL. I didn't even open it.

Read one non-fiction per month? Almost, I'm at 11.5 right now.

Read more classics? Check! I read Anna Karenina, Lolita and To Kill a Mockingbird (which wasn't on the list) but I didn't get to Crime and Punishment yet.
