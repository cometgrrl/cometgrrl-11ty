So, I'm falling behind on my running goals. :( Two weeks of traveling in Romania (and a weekend in Paris), and 10 days post surgery without running has really ruined my progress.

Year-to-date total is 48 miles. To meet my stretch goal of 500 miles for the year, I need to run 42 per month. So that puts me 78 miles behind already, and Q1 isn't even over.

My Next Race:

I'm running the 10K and I'm super excited! This will be my first race of the year!

Not much progress in other areas, but I did pick up a few new Romanian words on my trip, like la buci. :)
