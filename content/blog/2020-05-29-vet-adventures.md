Yesterday, I noticed Roxy had a weird looking spot on her tongue, and after emailing a pic to the vet, determined it looked infected. So today we went to the vet.

Turns out she is almost all healed already, unknown cause (maybe she bit it, maybe she was stung by that bee she was trying to eat). Treatment: monitor it, and maybe give her some very weak salt water.

I won't gross everyone out with a photo. Just let me say that getting a good look at the underside of a 10 lb dog's tongue is not easy, and getting a photo is almost as hard.

I'm thankful my vet is open, and they are trying to keep everyone safe and healthy by only allowing pets to come in and asking people to wait in their cars. Except it was 90 degrees this afternoon. I was a bit amazed, people watching-- people not wearing masks, or with it on but tucked under their chin instead over their mouth and nose, or over their mouth but not their nose, sit on the bench by the front door and chitchat.

What's the point of even wearing a mask if you're not going to wear it correctly??!
