I think all women should read this book.  Wait, I take that back.  I think all women and all men should read this book.

Career minded, family minded, or neither... I think it's amazing that there are so many ways in which women hurt themselves and each other, and so many ways in which just being a woman makes it harder to succeed.

Go, read it!
