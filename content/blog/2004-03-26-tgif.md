There's no Friday Five today. Hmmpt! I finally attempt to complete it on Friday and it's not there! Guess that means I have to think of something else to write about this fine Friday morning. The torrential rains of yesterday and last night have left us with a beautiful sunny day, at least for the time being. I received an email last week from the infamous (to some) DD, in response to a message about my new cell number, asking what time would be good for him to call me. Since it was the weekend, I said anytime was fine, not really expecting a call, as that's just the way things normally are. It's impossible to explain my surprise when, not only did he call, he called from CA about an hour away from me. Everyone's got questions and I don't know who has the answers. Someone actually wanted to make sure I wasn't "getting into another mess" again. All I know is that as much as things have changed (and will continue to change), some things, surprisingly, stayed the same. I have to say, I haven't stayed up til 5am in a long time. And once again, I was up until past 5, slept until 7:30 and then tried to go to work. Needless to say, yesterday was a very, very long day for me. It's amazing how much I missed being with someone who I get along with so well as to be able to stay up all night just talking. Friends like that are few and far between for me.
