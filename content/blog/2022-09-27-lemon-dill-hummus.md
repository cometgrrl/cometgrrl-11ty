For my book club this past weekend, I made Lemon Dill Hummus.

I used to dislike dill. Or maybe I never really ate dill except for dill pickles, which I hate, so I thought I also hated dill the herb.

Lately, it turns out I really love it. I love tzatziki (although I make mine without mint), and I love dill potato salad (hold the mayo).

Rather than look up a recipe, I mentally adapted my typical hummus recipe. It turned out pretty good, although **very** lemon-forward.

**Lemon Dill Hummus**

Ingredients

- 1 can chickpeas

- 1/4 c olive oil (can sub aquafaba–the liquid from the canned chickepeas–if you'd prefer no oil)

- 2 tbsp tahini

- 1/2 c fresh lemon juice

- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (you can use fresh garlic, but it often overpowers the hummus)

- 1/2 c dill, split in half

- dash of salt

Directions

1. Remove the stems from dill and chop 1/4 c of dill. Put aside.

3. Mix everything else in a high-powered blender or a food processor until smooth. I generally add the olive oil slowly so that I can get just the right consistency (by adding more or less than the amount in the recipe).

5. Stir in the remaining dill by hand, transfer to serving dish, and garnish with any remaining dill.

I served this hummus with plain pita chips, and garlic-parmesan pretzel crisps. It would also be good with cucumber slices or carrots.

As I mentioned, it came out very lemony. If I were making it again, I might switch it to 1/3 c each of olive oil and lemon juice, and then use olive oil or aquafaba to thin it to your desired consistency.

Originally, I had planned to also serve tzatziki dip as well. However, due to time constraints, I didn't get to it. I will be making it later this week along with some tofu, and I'll try to share some photos and a recipe when I do.
