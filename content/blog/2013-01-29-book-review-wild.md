_Wild_ by Cheryl Strayed

My rating: 2.5 / 5

This book is tough to rate.  I wanted to like it, and I read it really quickly and _mostly_ enjoyed it.  But in the end, I just couldn't relate to Cheryl.  Personally, I was expecting a life changing experience, an open, honest, memoir, etc.  Instead, I feel like I got a book about **\[spoiler alert, stop reading now if you don't want to know any details\]** a woman's who's mother died, causing her to go on a sex and heroin binge, ruin her marriage and undertake a 90 day backpacking trip that, really, was probably not her best idea.

I kept waiting for her to have some emotional breakdown or revelation that never came.  There was no big watershed moment.  The biggest thing seems to be her deciding that she was OK as-is.

Did I miss something?  Was there a hidden meaning, some hidden layer here that I missed?  All I see is that she got really lucky.  She was unprepared, over-packed, and out of money.  She is lucky she didn't die from any number of things.  That being said, the one moment in the book that did feel real, that got my attention, was when she was slightly off the PCT on an unexpected side trail and ran into the bow hunters.  I felt for her there, but again, I kept coming back to the fact that she could have, SHOULD have, been more prepared.  Mace, pepper spray, etc, any of those things would have been extremely useful for her to have had with her on the PCT and I think she just got lucky.
