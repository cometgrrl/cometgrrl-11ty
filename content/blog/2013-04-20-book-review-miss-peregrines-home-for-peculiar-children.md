_Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children_ by Ransom Riggs My rating: 2 / 5

_Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children_ really seemed like it would be an awesome book.  It was recommended by someone in my book club and I had such high hopes.  The description calls it "a spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography".

The concept of this story is brilliant, and something I would love to read about.  I love the idea of "peculiar" children and a haven for them.  To be honest, it reminds me a bit of Hogwarts, in a way.  Add in time travel (of sorts) into the mix, and it really does sound like a winner.

The problems, however, start with the main character/narrator, Jacob.  He's a whiny, indulgent, rich kid.  It was really hard to relate, and he was mildly annoying starting with chapter one.  As for the other characters, I felt that the "peculiars" were just sort of stuck into the story at random, usually followed by a photo.  For me, the photos did not add to the story, in part because of the way they were just there.  There were also some plot elements that seemed like they were important, but were never addressed.

When we do finally actually meet the peculiars (rather than just hear about them), we meet Emma.  Emma, although she appears to be the same age as Jacob, is actually 70.  There is never really any explanation as to why the "children" act like and think of themselves as children despite being in their 70s.  Emma was involved with Jacob's grandfather, Abe, when he was Jacob's age.  Now that Jacob has arrived at the home, she is flirting (and kissing) Jacob.   Umm, what??

I think the worst part of this book, however, is the cliffhanger ending.  There is no resolution and the novel just ends.   Oh, I guess I'm supposed to waiting patiently for book 2?

Lastly, this is book is not scary, frightening, or really even remotely scary.  Overall, it was disappointing.
