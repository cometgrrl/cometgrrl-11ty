While Justin's family was visiting from England, we took a trip up to Napa Valley and drank lots and lots of wine. It was a pretty funny trip, but I think 25+ wines in one day is a little much for me. Here's all the wineries we stopped at for wine tastings.... My favorite wine is the desert wine we got from Freemark Abbey! Day One Robert Mondavi Winery Franciscan Oakville Estate Day Two Chateau Montelena Winery Silver Rose Cellars Duckhorn Vineyards Pine Ridge Vineyards Stag's Leap Winery Niebaum-Coppola Beringer Day three Terra Valentine Freemark Abbey Clos Du Bois Geyser Peak Papapietro Perry Hop Kiln
