Justin and I just got back from our safari trip in Tanzania! We had a wonderful, amazing time, and saw a lot of fabulous things! For Kim's wedding, we stayed at the Zamani Resort on the island of Zanzibar. After 4 days of enjoying the sun, pool and beach here, we traveled by bus, plane, and land cruiser to Lake Manyara, and then to Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater.
