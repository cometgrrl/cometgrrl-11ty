When I was little, I wanted to be an astronaut. Or maybe a veterinarian. Or even better, an astronaut veterinarian who saves dogs in space.

And then I realized that vets must deal with blood and dead animals. Suddenly it wasn't so interesting anymore.

For the most part, I don't think I had one clear job in mind or really spent much time thinking about it. I just wanted to read books, play video games, and hang out with my dog. Thinking about jobs was boring! Even when I was in college, I still had no idea what my dream job would be. I'm a late bloomer, I guess?

Today's art is (an AI render of) `a photo of a Maltese dog` `wearing a space helmet and floating in space.`
