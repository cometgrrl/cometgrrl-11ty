I don't understand men. I've given up.

Maybe it's my fault. HA! Telling someone who has said they don't want to date you that you miss them, maybe it was overboard, but HEY WE WERE FRIENDS at one time…. anyhow, it's just hard to be honest and say what i feel, when my email gets an answer that says "yeah maybe" … in answer to one trivial question at the end.

Ahh well…. things "always work out in the end"? I told someone that once, and I really believed it when I said it…. HA what did I know?
