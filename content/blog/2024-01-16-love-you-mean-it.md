If you're a fan of romantic comedies, enemies to lovers, and fake dating tropes, then this book is for you! _Love You, Mean It_ by Jilly Gagnon tells the story of Ellie Greco. When a local real estate developer's plans threaten the family business, Greco's Deli, Ellie goes to great lengths to stop them.

While our protagonist does make some cringe-worthy choices, I still thoroughly enjoyed this. Ellie made her choices with the best intentions in mind, and like her, as a person who sometimes lacks self-confidence, I can relate to her state of mind. And I'm sure you'll be rooting for her, just like I was.

Even though the premise is completely different, this reminded me of the movie _How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_. The chemistry between our main characters, Ellie and Theo, perhaps?

If you're looking for a fun beach read, or something warm and fuzzy to keep you warm this winter, I highly recommend _Love You, Mean It_.

★★★★
