The questions are a little random this week.... until you realize what movie they're from.

1. **So — so on Monday, what happens?** Hopefully I won't hear anyone say "Sounds like somebody has case of the Mondays." In theory, it will be just another Manic Monday
2. **What was that ruckus?** It was Indy, he's always barking!
3. **What do you know about trigonometry?** a2 + b2 = c2
4. **Vodka? When do you drink vodka?** "Whenever" ... I drink vodka when I'm having a Moscow Mule! Great cocktail, although usually you'll find me drinking Gin, Tequila or Wine.
5. **How’d you like to go fishing this weekend?** Uhh, no. I'm vegetarian, generally prefer not killing animals (including fish) for sport, and even if you're "throwing them back" you are still hurting them.

Brought to you by Friday 5.

PS. It's _The Breakfast Club._
