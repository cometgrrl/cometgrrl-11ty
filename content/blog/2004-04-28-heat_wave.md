All over California, we have been having a heat wave this week. Given my choice of the nice, sunny weather we had here during March, and the March of 2003 I spent buried under snow in Maryland, I'll take a hot and steamy week or two in April, in exchange for the wonderful lack of snow. This picture shows how even Elvis and Marilyn are feeling the heat this week. Coincidentally, I met them while I was in Hollywood for my cousin Cathy's wedding reception earlier this month. With any luck, I won't be working overtime this weekend and I will finally make it back to the beach this weekend.
