I don't really feel like writing an insightful, witty, or entertaining post today. My creativity is lacking and so is my motivation.

What I would like to say, though, is you do you. There's no right way or wrong way to feel right now (or ever). How you feel is how you feel. What is we can do is choose how we react to our feelings.

Tonight, I choose to react to my feelings by curling up with a good book (An Echo in the Bone, Outlander book 7), my lovely puppies, Dexter, and after reading, by going to bed early.

See y'all tomorrow!
