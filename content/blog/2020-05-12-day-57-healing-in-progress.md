You might remember that I burned my hand about 2 weeks ago. Thanks to everyone who's asked how I'm doing, the answer (regarding my hand) is just fine!

I've been wrapping it in gauze and keeping it covered up for the most part. The good news is that it doesn't hurt very much, but it sure does look bad. Most, but not all, of the burned top layer skin has come off.

It doesn't do well in the sun, and the recommendation is to avoid direct sunlight on burns AND on new scars. I can't keep it wrapped up forever, so today I ordered some SPF 50 rated fingerless gloves. I'm going to look a bit like Michael Jackson, sporting just one white glove.
