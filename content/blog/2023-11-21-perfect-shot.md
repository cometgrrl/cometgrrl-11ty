_Perfect Shot_ by Steve Urszenyi is an action-packed spy thriller. Featuring FBI, CIA, Interpol and MI5/M16, just to name a few of the alphabet soup of agencies involved. It's got bombs, _nuclear_ bombs_,_ spies, espionage, chase scenes, _Les Catacombes,_ and more.

Our protagonist, Alex Martel, is a former sniper turned spy. I love the that novel features a strong female main character, and that, apart from a few flashback memories, doesn't center on any romantic interests. This was a quick, engaging read, and I finished it in one day.

_A Perfect Shot_ almost feels as though it were written to be a movie. I can see the plot fitting into an under-two-hour action movie nicely. The characters are interesting, but except for Alex, they are very one dimensional. For example, Caleb shows up _everywhere_ but at the end, we still know next to nothing about him. I suppose this is to be expected since he's a spook?

If you like spy thrillers, and want a quick, fun read, then I highly recommend this one.

★★★★
