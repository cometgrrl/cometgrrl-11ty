_The Night House_ by Jo Nesbo is a modern take on the classic horror novel. In some ways, this reminded me a lot of Stephen King's classic, _It._ Our narrator and protagonist is fourteen-year old Richard Elauved,. Richard is an orphan, sent to live with his aunt and uncle after the death of his parents in a tragic fire.

This story has lots of layers, and I don't want to give away too much by sharing what those are. Let's just say that Richard may not be the most reliable narrator.

In _The Night House,_ there are disappearing children, a haunted house, an evil mad man, and other creepy crawlies.

Recommended for fans of Stephen King, and those looking for a horror novel with a psychological twist combined with many unexpected plot twists.

★★★
