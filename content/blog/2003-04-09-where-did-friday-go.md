the friday five

1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  
    Too many….I move a lot and I honestly don't know… but my mom's been in the same house since I was in kindergarten.
2. Which was your favorite and why?  
    I liked the townhouse my dad rented in Gilroy… it was close to things and I could ride my bike and make friends.
3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  
    It all depends on the reason for the move… if moving is less stressful than staying where I was, then it's exciting. I think the moving process itself is stressful, but once it's done it can be exciting.
4. What's more important, location or price?  
    Both, I wouldn't live in a dangerous area for a good price, but I also can't afford 90210.
5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  
    I want a big yard (for the dogs) and a pool. I also want hardwood floors, I hate carpet.
