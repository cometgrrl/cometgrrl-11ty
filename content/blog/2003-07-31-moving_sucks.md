I spent all of yesterday afternoon and evening moving... with the help of two very sweet guys.. Ryan and Chance THANKS so much! All my stuff is now at Brendan's house. The dogs have been fairly well-behaved thus far, just a little bit of barking out of Bailey before bedtime and while I was in the shower this morning. Sometimes I still can't believe that I'm actually moving back to Cali. It's exciting and scary all at once. It's been 6 years since I moved here. And everyone I know back there has pretty much moved on. Last night I actually had the first shimmer of feeling that I am going to miss it here. Well, I certainly won't miss the weather, and I won't miss my job... but there really are some things I will miss. Today, I have to go back to my old apartment and get the last bits of my stuff and make some sort of attempt to clean. Hopefully it won't take too long, because I think we might go to the bar tonight for trivia. Last week at the bar was very, very entertaining... and so were the stories afterwards. Sonoma's is always a good time.
