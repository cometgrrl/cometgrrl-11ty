2013Â is over, and now it's time to see what's in store for 2014.

I have so many interests and desires, that it's hard to pick just a few goals. However, I do know that setting too many goals can be counterproductive. For 2014, I would like to categorize my goals and have just a few goals per category. My categories will be running, self-improvement, and reading.

Not surprisingly, these goals are very similar to last year's. Ideally, I will do a monthly check-in to keep myself accountable.

Fitness:

- Run at least 300 miles
- Run 6-10 races
    - I'm already signed up for these races:
        - Brazen's Coyote Hills 10K
        - Brazen's Bay Breeze 5K
        - Surfer's Path Capitola Half Marathon
- And I'm sure I'll run these:
    - Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5K
    - Santa Run Silicon Valley 5K

Self-improvement:

- Make yoga a habit
    - Practice once a week
- Finish Fluenz Spanish 2 and 3
- Improve on learning Romanian
- Focus on weight loss but don't obsess
- Complete Music Theory book including practice exercises (book and audio CD)

Reading:

- Read at least one non-fiction book each month
- Read more classics (continued from 2013):
    - Anna Karenina
    - Lolita
    - Crime and Punishment
