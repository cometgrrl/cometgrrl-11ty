These creepy, crawly, DISGUSTING things are all over my yard. Here's the best picture I could get while trying not to get too close, holding the flashlight, steadying the camera, keeping the dogs from eating it, and making sure the damn thing didn't touch me...  
\[photo has been lost, boo!\]

  
Besides staying away from the salamander invasion currently taking place outside, I have been working on the website a little. I've updated the road trip pictures and actually placed some of them in a photo gallery. All pictures from the first three days (up to Arkansas) can be viewed \[these are also missing\].
