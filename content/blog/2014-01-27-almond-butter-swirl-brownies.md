Today I hosted my book club's quarterly non-fiction discussion. Since we usually do a potluck style gathering, I thought I would try this cool recipe for black bean brownies that I came across through findingvegan.com.

Everyone raved about how good they were, and then I confessed that not only were they vegan, gluten and soy free, they are also primarily made out of black beans!

Ingredients

- 1 15 oz. can black beans, well rinsed and drained
- 2 chia eggs (2 Tbsp chia seeds + 6 Tbsp water)
- 3 Tbsp coconut oil, melted
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder 
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup maple syrup or agave (I used agave)
- 1/4 cup + 2 tsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup Justin's Maple Almond butter 
- 1/3 cup dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips + more for topping

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Lightly grease a 12-slot standard size muffin pan (I use Spectrum Coconut Oil spray)
3. Prepare the "chia eggs" by mixing the chia seeds and water in a bowl and let sit for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add "chia eggs" and all other ingredients up to and including the baking soda to a food processor or blender (I used a Vitamix) and pulse until smooth and well mixed.  The mixture should be roughly the consistency of chocolate frosting when done.  Add a Tbsp or two of water and pulse if it seems too thick.  It should not be runny, so don't add too much!
5. Add the chocolate chips and stir.
6. Transfer mixture to muffin tin, smoothing the tops with a spoon or your finger.
7. Add even amounts of the almond butter to each muffin tin, and swirl with a toothpick or knife. You can substitute peanut butter or normal almond butter, if it's not sweetened already, blend in 2 Tbsp of powdered sugar before adding to muffin tin.
8. Bake for 20-26 minutes. The top of each brownie should be dry and the edges should start to pull away. No jiggle, but don't over cook.
9. Remove and let cool for 20-30 minutes before removing from muffin tins.

Enjoy!
