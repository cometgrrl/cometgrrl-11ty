Since it seems unlikely that I'll be going back to work at the office, or really out in public with other people, any time soon, I've been thinking a lot about things to do at home.

Here are some of the items on my list of things to do/try:

- The 7th Continent - a cooperative/solo choose-your-own-adventure game
- My 1000 piece puzzle of purple succulents
- Wash and groom the dogs since I think going to the groomers is out right now -- I've cut Indy's hair/fur quite a few times, but I have never tried to do Roxy so this will be an adventure
- Rewatch West World so I know what the f\*%$# is going on in season 3
- OZARK SEASON THREE tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, I can't wait. I love this show!
- Meditation, daily, longer than 5 minutes
- Exercise. I've been joining classes from my favorite local gym via zoom. As long as I don't re-injure my stupid shoulder, I should be able to continue.
- Running. I'd like to get back into shape to run a 10k when we're allowed out of quarantine. 1/2 marathons are out because of my myriad injuries, but I'm hoping I can get up to 10k.
- If I'm really motivated, finally repainting the green wall in my living that I hate. It's going to be purple and it will be AMAZING!

And, as I mentioned previously, I'd like to start drawing. I got this cool book and hopefully I'll get started this weekend!
