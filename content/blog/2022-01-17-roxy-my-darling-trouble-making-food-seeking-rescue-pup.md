I've been volunteering with dog rescues and fostering for over 10 years now. It probably comes as no surprise that I'm a foster failure and adopted one of my foster dogs. The surprising bit is that it was only ONE failure.

It all started with Pepper, a stray dog one of my co-workers found. After that, I became a regular volunteer, and it was later that year I met and adopted Roxy.

When I met Roxy in November of 2011, she was scared, skinny, and only a little cute.

Roxy had been picked up a stray. She had a broken leg, and all the toes in one paw were also broken. The rescue paid for her to have surgery to save the leg, and she had just finished her recovery (several weeks of crate rest) when she came to me.

When I got her home, Indy immediately fell in love with her. It took me about a day, and then I knew she was never leaving.

You can see here how much they loved each other, right from the start.

It's been over 10 years now. There have been many more foster dogs, and only a few that I considered keeping. Tessa would be at the top of that very short list.

For now, I have my hands full with Roxy, Indy, and Dexter. Indy and Dexter are easy, it's Roxy who's the troublemaker. Even after 10 years of the good life inside, with gourmet food and treats, and more toys than any dog could ever need, she is still always on the lookout for food. She climbs the cat tree multiple times per day to try and get to Dexter's food, and then I have to rescue her from the top of the dresser because she can't get down.

Even though she gets into trouble, I can't imagine not having this little fluffball around. I won't waste space here preaching about animal rescue, other than to say, save a life and adopt don't shop! If you want to know more about the cause or why I feel breeders are bad in general, please leave a comment or message me.
