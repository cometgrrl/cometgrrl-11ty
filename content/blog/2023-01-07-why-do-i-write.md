Since I learned to read, I have been an avid reader. I wasn’t much of a writer until around high school, although my mom will be quick to point out I won a writing contest in second grade. It was a _very_ short story, and yes, I beat out around 40 or 50 other second graders for the wonderful prize of a copy of Stuart Little!

In high school, I got into writing poetry. I even had a poem published (online) once. I wonder if I could even find where that was or if the website even exists today.

I started blogging when I was in college. It was partly a way to keep my family updated on my life, since I went to college in Maryland, a long way from home (California). While there have been breaks, blogging is something that I've done for a long time now at this point. I don't think WordPress existed when I started my first blog!

Once, I attempted to write a short story/novella/novel. Ok, if I'm honest, it was never going to be longer than a short story. It was about salamanders. It was in a word doc and I have somehow lost that document. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sad or not.

I write because I can.

I write because I enjoy it.

I write to express myself.

I write for fun.

I write for work.

I write to leave my mark on the world.
