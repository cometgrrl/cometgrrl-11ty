Got lots of Thanksgiving leftovers that you don't know how to use?

Here are some ideas and some of the treats I have been making myself.

**Cranberry Ice Cream** - use leftover cranberry sauce to make ice cream!  I made mine vegan - one can chilled not-lite coconut milk plus one cup sugar plus 1 to 1.5 cups cranberry sauce and a dash of vanilla.  Blend and add chilled mix to an ice cream maker and voila, yummylishious ice cream!

**Cranberry Smoothie** - still have leftover cranberry sauce?  Mix with ice, non-dairy milk of your choosing and ice (and maybe a banana).  Blend and serve!

**Pumpkin Smoothie** - leftover pumpkin?  Yams?  Sweet potatoes?  Even if they are mixed into something sweet (like a pie), you can toss it in the blender with some ice and non-dairy milk and have a fun smoothie.

**Hot Pumpkin** (like hot chocolate but with pumpkin instead) - this works best if you have pumpkin puree and not, say, a pumpkin pie you want to use. Add about 2 tablespoons per cup of non-dairy milk, some pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger) and blend. Then heat in a saucepan to a boil, reduce to simmer until it's a nice creamy drink. The original, more detailed, recipe can be found over at Healthy. Happy. Life.
