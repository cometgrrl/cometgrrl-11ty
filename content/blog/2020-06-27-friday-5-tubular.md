1. **Whatâ€™s your least favorite episode of your favorite television program?** The finale of How I Met Your Mother, and also Dexter.
2. **Across its series run, in what way did a favorite television program get worse?** Lost, definitely got worse in the final seasons.
3. **Among television programs you like very much, which ended far too soon?** Daredevil. I'm sure we'll see something new from Disney+ but it just won't be the same.
4. **Among television programs you like very much, which dragged on for too long?** Lost, The Walking Dead. I actually stopped watching The Walking Dead this season.
5. **What are some lines of dialogue you love from a favorite television program?** _"Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?"_
