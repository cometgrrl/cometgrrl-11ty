This "salad" is a favorite of mine from Zanotto's. I love it because it's a great grab and go lunch, and it's packed with protein, and super tasty with a nice mix of spicy, sweet, and tangy.

This is my attempt to recreate it, ymmv.

Ingredients --

- extra firm or firm tofu
- oil for cooking tofu (I prefer avocado oil for high heat cooking)
- toppings
    - peanuts
    - green onions, chopped
    - garlic, minced
- marinade/sauce
    
    - soy sauce
    - maple syrup
    
    - hot chili oil
    - rice vinegar

Directions --

1. Press your tofu!
2. While the tofu is pressing, chop your green onions and mince your garlic. For 8-10oz of tofu, I used 2-3 green onions and about 3 cloves of garlic.
3. Cut tofu into bite size pieces, I like mine small, but you can do bigger, it's your choice.
4. Pan fry the tofu with a touch of oil until brown (on all sides as much as possible)
5. Add tofu and toppings to bowl/container. You may have noticed by now that there's no quantities listed next to the ingredients. This is a totally customizable recipe, so I've left it very open. Add a few peanuts or a lot. I like peanuts, and I put about a ratio of 3:1 (tofu:peanuts).
6. Make the marinade. If you're nervous, make it in a separate bowl. If you're adventurous, put it directly in with the tofu. You'll want enough total volume to coat with some left over.

Here are some tips on how I make the marinade. I start with the soy sauce, this is my primary ingredient. Then a splash of maple syrup for sweetness. Hot chili oil -- add to your tolerance. I don't like it to overpower the other flavors, so I used just a dash or two. For the rice vinegar, again, just a dash or two. I add very small amounts of everything and then add more to adjust the spicy, sweetness, tangy as desired.

Other tips -- I completely forgot about lime juice, but usually I use lime juice and not rice vinegar. You can also add fresh diced or sliced chili peppers, like jalape√±o or serrano peppers. For sweetness, if you don't like maple syrup, you can use brown sugar or agave. I actually think brown sugar works best flavor-wise but maple syrup is easier. Other options to add would include ginger (grated) and rice noodles.

I usually eat this as-is or chilled, but you can throw it on top of rice, noodles, or on some greens to make an actual salad.
