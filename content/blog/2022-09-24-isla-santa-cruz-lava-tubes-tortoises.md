On Thursday, we disembarked on Santa Cruz Island. While here, we walked in a lava tube, and went to a tortoise habitat.

We didn't go all the way through the lava tube, as parts of it are quite low/narrow and muddy. However, it's estimated at 1km in length, which is quite long!

After exploring the lava tube, we went to Rancho Primicias, the Giant Tortoise Reserve.

Tortoise selfie! This is was the first day I was sick on the trip, so pardon my expression.
