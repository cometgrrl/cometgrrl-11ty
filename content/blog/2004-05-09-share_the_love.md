There are many ways to show you care about animals. If you already have a pet, give it a hug! If you don't, there are many animals in need of homes and loving care.

At Petfinder, there are 1,000s of listings for animals in shelters nationwide. You will only see animals from CA here on my site, but click the link and start searching if you would like to find a loving animal near you. Or, if you are in California and would like to adopt from Pet Friends, please visit the website -- there are lots of adorable animals waiting for a home. I started volunteering at Pet Friends today. It's very sad to see how many animals are in need of loving owners and a stable home. Many of the animals at Pet Friends have been there for over a year! If I had room in my house, several of them would be coming home with me. There are too many homeless animals and not enough people doing something to fix it. If you can help out an animal, please do so! They will appreciate it more than you can ever know.
