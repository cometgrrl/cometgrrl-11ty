Today is almost over, so it's more like 3 days left. I'm leaving at 10am or so Saturday morning, and it's Tuesday afternoon now. I'M STARTING TO PANIC! Today is happy hour with co-workers ... and whoever else wants to come. It should be a good time. We're going to Sonoma's, of course. There is so much stuff left to do this week. I have a large (HUGE) box of books that needs to be mailed, I have to try and make sure everything fits in my car, I still have stuff that I'm not taking with me. There's dinner with Steph on Friday, lunch with Cathy on Thursday, lunch with everyone at work whenever that gets planned, a new hard drive that I should have installed in my computer a week ago still sitting on the floor. Tons of work left to do, and I don't know how I will ever get it all done by Saturday morning. I'm not motivated to do it, I spend all my free time at Ryan and Chance's apartment. The fact that they are right across (literally) the parking lot from where I am staying makes it really hard for me to get anything productive done... I'm alway there! And I know they think they bore me ... they just haven't realized that I do enjoy hanging out there and I'm the type of girl that can be amused by just about anything. Almost time for happy hour, no time for panic......
