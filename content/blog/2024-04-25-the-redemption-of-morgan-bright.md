Chris Panatier's _The Redemption of Morgan Bright_ is a fantasy-horror novel with a patriarchy reminiscent of _The Handmaiden's Tale._ In a world where men can have their wives admitted for psychiatric care against their will, all under the guise of "domestic psychosis," Morgan Bright goes into Hollyhock Asylum with a secret.

The novel is told from the perspective of Charlotte and Morgan and is interspersed with excerpts from police interviews and text messages. As the story unfolds, we learn that Morgan desperately wants to understand what happened to her sister, Hadleigh, who died while wandering alone along the road outside the asylum.

All in all, I felt the novel moved at a very slow pace. There's a lot of character development and narrative twists throughout. However, the supernatural aspect of the horror elements didn't do much for me. Additionally, the police interviews and text messages, while important to the story-telling, felt forced and intrusive.

If supernatural novels with an evil patriarchy are your jam, you might like this more than I did.

★★★
