My gin collection - an assortment of gin from around the world. From left to right: Madison Park (Montr√©al), Venus (Santa Cruz, California), G'Vine (France), New Amsterdam (Modesto, California), abd Sacred Springs (New Zealand). In the back, in the decanter, you can't see it well, but it's a yellow gin, ungava (Canadian).

It's national gin & tonic day!!! I'm a huge fan of gin, and to be honest, my current gin stock is a little less than typical. I'm out of the Botanist, one of my favorites, and Leopold's, another great gin.  

To celebrate, I had a zoom chat with a long time friend from work, who also loves gin. He lamented the fact that he's drinking St. George Terroir rather than Botanivore. Luckily, I recently purchased G'Vine, which is quickly becoming a new favorite.

When I can go shopping again, I'm looking forward to finding Elephant Gin (made with apples and "rare" African botanicals) and O.R.E. 118 (apparently it's raw vegan AND made from grapes!).
