As of today, I will be working for CTB McGraw Hill, in Monterey, California, beginning in January. However, I am still waiting for other job offers. I may receive a better offer from Symitar, in San Diego, or Electronic Clearing House, Inc, in Camarillo, before then. Symitar will be calling the week of 12/29 with their hiring decision, and ECHO will be calling shortly to arrange for my interview. It seems as though my months of job hunting are finally starting to pay off. One offer, and hopefully several more on the way! =) ~ Happy Holidays! ~
