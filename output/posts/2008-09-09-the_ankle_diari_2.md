3/7/2008 - the surgery So, this is the big day! I was really not looking forward to surgery, even if it was just foot / ankle surgery. Mom was very sweet and came up to take me. Before I left in the morning, I wrote a little note for my doctor / surgeon: ![](images/n608716479_979313_5326.jpg) Everything went very well (only three screws, not five!), except I panicked a bit when I first woke up after being under anesthesia. I had one of those little air masks on to make sure I was getting enough oxygen, but my nose was running and I hated that mask. Also, I wasn't supposed to be in any pain, but ow ow ow, my foot REALLY hurt when I woke up. After we got back from my surgery, surprisingly, I wasn't sleepy. So I taught Mom how to play Guitar Hero and waited up for David to come check on me when he got done with work. All in all, I'd say it went very well. ![](images/n608716479_996133_6013.jpg)
