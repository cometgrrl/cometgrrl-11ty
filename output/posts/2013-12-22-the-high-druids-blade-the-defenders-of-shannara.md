![](images/91PgxuAjfCL._SL1500_.jpg) **_The High Druid's Blade: The Defenders of Shannara_** by Terry Brooks

Mr. Brooks has written many excellent fantasy novels, and I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't read enough of them. Quite some time ago, I read _The Original Shannara Triology_, which I enjoyed very much. After that, I did not continue with the Shannara books, although I'm not sure why.

Years later, I came across _Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold!,_ the first novel in the Magic Kingdom of Landover series. This, at the time, happened to be free for Kindle, and was the first book I read using Amazon's Kindle app on my iPhone, before I purchased my first Kindle. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Magic Kingdom series and reminded myself that I needed to return to the Shannara series.

As it turns out, I forgot, until I happened to come across _The High Druid's Blade,_ the latest of many in the Shannara series_,_ on NetGalley. I was thrilled when I was approved to receive an advanced copy.

The world of Shannara consists of The Four Lands: the Northland, home to the trolls; the Southland, the land of men; the Eastland, where the dwarves and gnomes fight for territory; the Westland, where the Elven race resides. Present knowledge and science has been lost in Shannara, and science has been replaced by magic. But the magic is wild, and almost uncontrollable.

_The High Druid's Blade_ tells the story of Paxon Leah, a descent many generations removed from Flick Ohmsford and Menion Leah, from _The Sword of Shannara._ Paxon doesn't know much of magic, as it's outlawed in the Southlands and policed by the Federation and controlled by the Druids.

Paxon's sister is kidnapped by a mysterious and dangerous man, and Paxon is the only one who can save her. Over the course of the novel, Paxon learns much about himself, his family, and magic.

While readable as a standalone novel, I feel that many readers would prefer to start at the beginning, with _The Sword of Shannara._ There are many references to historical events and people, which I imagine are covered in some of the novels that I skipped.

Like _The Original Shannara Triology,_ I highly enjoyed this book. Brooks has created a robust, compelling and magical world, along with an engaging set of characters. I can't wait to go back to beginning and read them all.

_Disclaimer: I received an advance copy of this through NetGalley, in exchange for a fair and honest review._

★★★★
