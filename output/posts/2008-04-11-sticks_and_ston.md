Actually, all it took was one good fall off the bouldering wall @ Touchstone in San Jose to break my bones. In February, I fell about 10 ft and landed on my ankle and broke my talus bone. 2 weeks later I was in surgery getting three screws in my ankle. Almost 7 weeks later, and I'm still on crutches and will be for another 3 weeks (at least!). I posted all the pictures on Facebook and you can see them here. Everyone @ work has been wonderful. So many people offered to drive me around, and the whole company came by after my surgery to bring me Indian food for lunch one day. David has also been great, he's so sweet and takes great care of me. I think I learned my lesson. Rock climbing with ropes is just as fun and waaaay safer. Just before my fall, I got belay certified at Planet Granite, and completed my first 5.10a climb. I'm so bummed that I haven't been able to climb for the last 7 weeks, and it looks like it will be another 7 before I'll be ready to go back.
