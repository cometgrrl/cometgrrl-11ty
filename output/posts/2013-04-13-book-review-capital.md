OK, so this book wasn't bad. I don't think I would call it good either. It's just not bad enough that I didn't quit in the middle, it's just almost good enough that I wanted to see how it ended. Â The problem is that it just sort of ends. No conclusion, for the most part.

The bad: long, a tad boring, not a super interesting topic, too many characters to really follow along at points.

The good: since not a lot happens, there is plenty of time for character development!
