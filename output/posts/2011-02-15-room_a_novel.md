_Room: A Novel_

by Emma Donoghue

  

This is not typically a book I would have selected myself, but it was promoted by Amazon as an editor's pick of the month.  After looking at it several times, I finally decided to give it a try.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

  

_Room_ is told from the perspective of Jack, a 5 year old boy who has never been outside of the  11 x 11 room he shares with his mother. I won't go into any details other than that, as I don't want to spoil the plot!  It can be a difficult read at times due to the perspective and the limited vocabulary and incorrect grammar of the 5 year old narrator, but I truly enjoyed this book.  There are a fair amount of negative reviews, but there are also many great reviews.  I think you just have to try it and if you like the first chapter, you should keep reading.

  

I found the story to be very involving and moving, and the whole novel was a quick, enjoyable read while I was traveling home from Romania.
