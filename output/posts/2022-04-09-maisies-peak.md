I haven't been hiking much lately, and I wanted to try out my hiking boots before going to Canada next month. We'll be doing some hiking at Banff National Park and I need to decide whether to pack them or not.

I decided to hike up to Maisie's Peak. In the past, I have hiked at Fremont Older Open Space Preserve, but I have never been to this part. AllTrails suggested starting from Stevens Creek County Park, and crossing over into Fremont Older, so that's what I did. The hike is listed as a moderate intensity hike of 2.5 miles, taking approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete.

The way up. Most of the trails on the Stevens Creek County Park side of my hike looked similar to this. Narrow, shady, in some places rocky, and there were a lot of steep areas, with some switch backs.

I was a little skeptical of the suggested parking, with AllTrails giving me coordinates on the map, rather than an address or a marked place. It did indeed turn out to be a real parking area, unfortunately it was closed.

Thankfully, there's a lot of trailheads in the area, and I had just passed an open parking location. I figured even if I had to pick a new route or destination for my hike, at least I could still hike from there. Luckily, the trail I ended up at led easily to my original intended route, and only added about a half mile to the total hike.

This is where I crossed into Fremont Older Open Space Preserve. Over here, the trails are wide, with fewer switch backs, and shade is rare.

In the end, the hike was approximately 3 miles, and it took me 50 minutes up and 30 minutes down, so the timing of 1 hour and 20 minutes was spot on, despite the slight detour.

There's a lovely view at the top, and a nice wide lookout area. Too bad there's no place to sit and no shade.

All in all, the hiking boots worked out pretty well. I may change the insoles, as right now I have in some custom insoles with arch support. They are a bit different from the ones I normally use, and hurt my feet a bit towards the end of this hike.

Also, I felt _very_ out of shape on the uphill parts of this hike. I really need to get out and get active again! Anyone local wanna go for a hike with me?
