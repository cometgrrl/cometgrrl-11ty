_Empire of the Damned_, by Jay Kristoff is the second novel in the Empire of the Vampire series.

I have always loved vampire novels, ever since reading _Interview with the Vampire_. _Empire_ has all the qualities that I loved from that series: a tortured main character with a sordid past, interesting other characters, epic world-building, lore, magic, and history.

Since this is the second in the series, I won't say too much about the plot. Like the first in the series, it's a pretty lengthy book at 709 pages. If you don't mind epic tales, love vampires, and a good story, I highly recommend this, but you'll need to start with the first book. You can find what I wrote about the first book in a mini review in this post.
