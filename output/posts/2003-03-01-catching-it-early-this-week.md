## the friday five

EXTENDED BODY:

1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?  
    Novels -- I'm a book freak!
2. What is your favorite novel?  
    I have too many list… Tons of Stephen King, Tom Robbins, all the LOTR books, Harry Potter…
3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  
    Nope.
4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  
    Dante's Inferno. I started, but I just can't finish.
5. What are you currently reading?  
    Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, by Tom Robbins. It's pretty entertaining. I think the whole novel takes place over the course of three days and follows the personal life (and adventures) of Gwen, a Seattle stock broker, over Easter weekend after the biggest stock market crash ever.
