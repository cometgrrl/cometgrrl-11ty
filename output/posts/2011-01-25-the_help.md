_The Help_  

By Kathryn Stockett

  

This book was amazing.  It's the story of three women living in Jackson, Mississippi in 1962.  The story intertwines the lives of several young white women, and the black women who have raised them and their children.

  

The story is easy to read, intriguing, and felt very real to me.  As someone who wasn't alive during the civil rights movement, this book allowed me to see how it might have felt to be there, to experience the pain and sadness of knowing good people were being mistreated and abused, and to see how the actions of each person can have a great impact in the lives of others.

  

I waited a long time to read this book.  I wasn't sure I would enjoy it, and the topic of a book centered around the beginnings of the civil rights movement just didn't seem appealing to me, but I am so glad that I read it.  

  

This book should touch your heart.  You might smile, and you'll probably cry.  In the end, hopefully you, like me, will feel motivated in some small way to make an impact in the lives of others, even if it's just something as simple as a kind word to someone less fortunate.
