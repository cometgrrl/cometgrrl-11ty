_The Clan of the Cave Bear_

by Jean M. Auel

  

_The Clan of the Cave Bear_ is a saga that starts with a Cro-Magnon child who is orphaned during an earthquake.  The child is then adopted and raised by Neanderthals.

  

This child is Ayla, who turns out to be a remarkable young woman.  She learns the ways of "the Clan", her adopted people, and is trained as a medicine woman by her adoptive mother, Iza. Along the way, Ayla realizes how different she is, and eventually sets out on her own.  

  

I'm currently reading book 4, _The Plains of Passage._  So far, books 1-2 were my favorites, and it was only in book 4 that I started to get bored.  Ayla and her companions are making a long journey in this book, and there are often pages and pages where nothing significant seems to happen.

  

Apart from this, the series has been interesting and very compelling.  I am looking forward to finishing book 4 and reading book 5, so that I can be ready to read book 6 when it comes out later this month!
