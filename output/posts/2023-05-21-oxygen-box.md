My dog Indy has been having seizure-like episodes for the last few weeks. Nothing obvious turned up after a visit to our vet, so we were waiting on a neurology consult, which, for non-emergent cases, can take weeks.

Today, he was having trouble breathing, so we went to the emergency vet. Turns out, he has congestive heart failure, and the seizures were likely not seizures but syncope (fainting).

Poor Indy has to spend the weekend in an “oxygen box” at the hospital. (pictured in the featured image)

We’re all missing him very much. ❤️
