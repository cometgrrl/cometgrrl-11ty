the friday five You have just won one million dollars: 1. Who do you call first? Call? I'm already out shopping. I'll call everyone later. 2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself? I wouldn't buy anything, I'd pay off my credit cards, my car loan, and my student loans. Then I'd buy a house or maybe I'd start my own company finally. 3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else? I would buy my dogs a trip to the vet. I know they'd rather have toys and such, but they really need to get their shots for the year. 4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom? I would give some to my family, to my parents. 5. Do you invest any? If so, how? I don't think there will be any left over, everything left is going into my business.
