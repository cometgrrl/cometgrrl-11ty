Ok... this movie is hailed as "_the most frightening horror movie since The Exorcist_". Here is what I thought.... It's sort of Stephen King's _The Stand_ meets Richard Matheson's _I am Legend_, but with zombies instead of vampires, and a lot more gore than the movie version of _The Stand._ Oh, and I didn't think it was scary. At all. I suppose the bloody scenes were meant to be scary, but it was just gross. _Jeepers Creepers_ scared me more than this movie did. Maybe I'm just jaded towards horror movies. I'm hard to scare, I've read a lot of Stephen King, a movie's gotta work hard to instill terror in my heart and get my pulse racing.
