Today, we spent the day at Isla Floreana.

We started with a hike at Punta Cormorant.

After our hike, we went snorkeling. I wish I had an underwater camera! A giant alpha male sea lion swam right next to me. He was so close I could almost touch him.

This afternoon we are kayaking and visiting Post Office Bay, also on Isla Floreana.
