OK... so my plan of keeping this updated with little mini reviews of the books I'm reading hasn't worked out so well. Since the last entry, I've read Speaks The Nightbird by Robert McCammon, Dirk Gently's Holistc Dective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul, both by Douglas Adams, and also Everything is Illuminated, a wonderful little novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. Oh, and I'm currently working on Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, although it's turning out to be a hard read for me! Hopefully soon I'll have time to post more about all these books!
