I thought I would be bored for Labor Day weekend, just staying at home while my mom had to work all weekend. So I drove to San Diego -- 430 miles! It's not a bad drive, just very boring all the way down I-5. Made it to Magic Mountain in 4 hours, thought I was going to be there early, but the last 100 miles (from LA to San Diego) took about 5 hours because of all the holiday traffic. I hate traffic. We were going to drive from SD to Las Vegas, but after my day of traffic from hell, we decided to skip it and go surfing instead. Third time surfing and I still suck, but eventually I'll get the hang of it! Sunday we went down to Tijuana. Neither of us had ever been, but I've been to Mexicali. My poor friend, I forgot to warn him that they don't flush toilet paper in Mexico. Tijuana was a blast. Sure, they lured us into the bar / restaurant with an offer for a bunch of stuff, and we ended up paying $40. We also got a LOT more than we had bargained for, especially in the tequila department. Tequila has never been my thing, and I don't think that is ever going to change. I've learned my lesson tho... After all the tequila, we were slightly delusional and for some time thought the idea of getting tattoos in TJ was a good one. Thank god I sobered up enough to realize that it wasn't. At all. Since I'll be back in MD at the end of the month, I think I might just get one while I'm there, at the same place I got the first one. We'll see if I can afford it or not....
