Syrup by Max Barry is one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. Scat has forsaken his given name of Michael in order to be more marketable. He's just graduated from college and dreaming of becoming a major player in the marketing business of Los Angeles when his million dollar idea hits. He's read somewhere that every American has at least 3 ideas worth a million dollars per year...and he can't wait to capitalize on his. With a vision of a catchy soda name, and a black can, Scat takes his idea to Coke. The book just gets better from there, as Scat tries to battle the piranhas at Coke, reclaim his ideas from his sneaky roommate, and save his yet to be started marketing career, all while falling in love. It's adventurous, bold, and daring. It's life in the fast world of advertising and marketing, where you have to fight for everything and can trust no one. And remember..._Taste is marketing..._
