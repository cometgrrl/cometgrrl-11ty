Horse!

I think I was around 3. Even though we lived in the city, for some reason, that day, we had our horse, Gypsy, in the backyard. I believe we were giving her a bath.

Sorry for the poor-quality image. That's actually a photo of my dad's TV playing home movies. I'm probably 8, and that's my pony, Midget.
