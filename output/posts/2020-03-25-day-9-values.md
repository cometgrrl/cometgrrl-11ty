There was definitely some potential for this to become just a list of what I did on a given day. I'm very happy to say, that's not the case (at least not today)!

Today, I want to talk about values. You can file this one under "sef-care 101". Everyone's values may be different, and that's ok. Values are what tells us what's important to us, what we care about, and about how we want to live our lives. As Tobias (more on Tobias in a minute) told me this morning, you can think about values as _import_ant because they signify things you want to import more of into your life.

I'm referring to values as "self-care 101" because values are a measure by which a person can judge if they are living a life that's authentic (for them). Personal goal setting has been difficult for me recently, and so I decided to start with values. Goals should be easy (easier?) once I know and understand my personal values and can discover goals that align with those values.

Back to Tobias now. Tobias is my super-awesome coach, and since the gym is closed down right now, we decided to work on values instead of strength-training today. You can check him out on his website at https://www.tobiasmcgowan.com/. Oh, and you can check out his book too, if that's your thing. Shameless plugs I know, but Tobias has been the single most influential person in my life in recent years with regards to my health and well-being, so it's deserved!

Ok, now you know why I think values are important (there's that word again!), and about Tobias, so we can get back to talking about values. I'm not going to share the entire process of I went through to discover mine, just the highlights.

Tobias asked me 5 deceptively simple questions and asked me to write down the answers. Then we went through those answers, discussed some more than others, and looked at things they had in common. Tobias did this all on his whiteboard, and later I put it into a mind map. I might share the mind map later on this week.

Here's what we came up with as my core values:

_Has anyone else gone through a value discovery process similar to this?_ _I'd love to hear/read about your experience, drop me a comment!_
