So, I've been trying to get in shape lately (really, the last YEAR).  My goal was to be able to run a 5k in 30 minutes.  I started out on the treadmill at our old apartment and progressed to actual running outside.  Often, I was only going 1.25 miles (one loop around the apartment complex) and even that was not very often.

  

Recently, I decided to get back into it and set a goal to run an actual 5K early next year.  And then my co-workers all signed up for the Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5k.  And they somehow convinced me to sign up too!

  

Three weeks to train (less now), and even David is going with me.  I ran about 15 miles in the last week and that's about as much as I ran in all of September and October combined! 

  

We'll see how I do... I still can't actually run for an entire 5k without walking, but I can do about 1/2 and my times are getting better.

  

At least it's an improvement over sitting on the couch all the time!
