Today is day 6 of my 30 day meditation challenge. I'm happy to say that I've completed 5 out 6 days, so I missed a day, but that was due to poor planning on my part.

Overall, it's pretty easy. I mean, c'mon, the general idea is to sit still with a clear mind and breathe deep. I can do that. The hard part is staying comfortable siting on the floor and not getting distracted by the puppies. I'm not usually a fidgety person, I don't tap my foot, or find it hard to sit still in general when I am doing things - reading, watching a movie, in a meeting, working, etc. But sitting still and just breathing is proving challenging for me.

All the excuses that I had before starting, and the puppies weren't one of them. Turns out they are my biggest obstacle because they don't like to be ignored. It's a little hard to visualize floating on a cloud or walking through an empty meadow with a dog barking at you and licking you. :(

Maybe she wants to meditate too? I wonder if there's such a thing as meditation for dogs.... hmm.

 If anyone has any thoughts or ideas on how to distract the dogs for 10 minutes each night, please send them my way. Locking them in another room isn't really a viable option, and neither is food. It would just take too much food to occupy them for the full 10 minutes.
