I've recently taken to reading xkcd, which I find quite funny. Especially the one linked here. It still amazes me how worked up people get about their "status" on social networking sites. Mine says "single" (or maybe even nothing) on Facebook, but don't take that too seriously, I just don't want to go through the embarrassment of asking my guy to "accept" a relationship request from Facebook! Also very funny is Not from Concentrate, which I just discovered today. It's written by a student at UMD and published in the Diamondback, UMD's student run newspaper. I haven't had a chance to look at them all, but I was reading while eating lunch today and couldn't stop laughing. Now, I love the comic Pearls Before Swine, and if you're read that, you'll have a sense of the kind of comics that I like.
