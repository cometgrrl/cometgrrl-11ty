Tessa is a Havanese-Terrier mix. She's a rescue dog, available for adoption through Jake's Wish Dog Rescue. As you can see by checking out this page, I have had the honor of fostering many great, cute dogs.

Tessa is -**the best**\- foster dog.\* 

Tessa is just over a year old, has only three legs, and is a huge cuddle bug. She doesn't know she is missing that leg, and she loves to play and can run and jump just fine without it. I bailed her out of the San Martin Shelter last month, where she was off with a very painful, partially healed broken leg. Poor girl couldn't walk without being in pain with her leg like that, so they had to amputate it.

Turns out that I know someone who saw Tessa get hit by a truck about a month before she turned in to the shelter. Before she could get to Tessa to see if she was OK, Tessa saw another car, and popped up and ran off after it like nothing had happened. This seems like it may have been how she broke her leg.

I really do not understand how this dog has not been adopted yet. Seriously. She is SO CUTE! And SO SWEET! All you people out there are missing out on AN AMAZING DOG! She is good with other dogs, loves going to doggie day care, she's good with cats, she's house trained and crate trained. What more could you want???

\*Except for Roxy, but she doesn't count because I knew I was going to adopt her within hours of bringing her home as a foster dog.
