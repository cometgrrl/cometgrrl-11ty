The movie Adaptation is the story of twin brothers, Charlie and Donald Kaufman, struggling to write a screenplay based on a non-fiction book called "The Orchard Thief". Nicholas Cage plays both brothers in the movie. And the movie credits list both Donald and Charlie Kaufman as the screen writers of the movie. Donald Kaufman was nominated for an Academy Award. Why is this unusual? --- Donald Kaufman doesn't actually exist, although credited in the movie. Don't believe me? Take a look at IMDB.com's listing for Donald Kaufman.
