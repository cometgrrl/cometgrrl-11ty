What makes me laugh? I have to say, this is not something I have given a lot of thought to in the past.

Some of my favorite comedy movies include _There's Something About Mary, Groundhog Day, American Pi_e, and _Office Space._ When I was younger, I loved _Ace Ventura Pet Detective_, _Dumber and Dumber_, and _Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure._ I haven't seen Ace Ventura in recent years, however, the other two definitely do not stand the test of time. Much of the humor now seems offensive to me.

For the most part, I don't enjoy humor at the expense of others. We can be funny without being racist, misogynistic, or cruel.

These days, a lot of my laughs come from the kids.
