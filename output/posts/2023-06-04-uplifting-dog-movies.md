When Indy returned from the hospital a few weeks ago, we decided our cinema theme of the week would be **_Uplifting Dog Movies_**.

We kicked off the series with _Lady and the Tramp._ I don't know if I ever saw this as a kid. It did not age well. It's pretty demeaning with its depictions of everyone at the Italian restaurant.

Next, we watched _Turner & Hooch._

> Another movie I probably saw as a kid.
> 
> It’s not as funny as I expected.
> 
> Tom Hanks is half-dressed for about half the movie. There are a lot of underwear scenes and scenes with his shirt off. Was this supposed to make the movie more appealing to certain audiences?
> 
> Hooch is obvi the best part of the movie. The kitchen scene reminded me how thankful I am that my troublemaker is only 10 lbs and limited in her destructive capabilities.
> 
> my Letterboxd review

I'll add here that I felt deeply betrayed by this movie. I specifically picked movies _where the dog **doesn't die**_**.** I was wrong about this one, and I'm still upset by this.

To round out the selection, we finished with _Oh My Dog._ _Oh My Dog_ is an Indian family comedy-drama, about a boy who raises a blind dog. This movie has it all–a cute dog, an evil villain with weird henchmen, and a feel-good ending. Oh, and it even features some dog agility!
