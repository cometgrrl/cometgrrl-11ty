I got a bike! I haven't had a bike since I was a kid and the last bike I remember having was pink.

Guess what? I still love pink bikes!

Check it out!  Isn't it a sweet ride? It's an Electra Townie 7D and I just love it!\[gallery type="rectangular" ids="563,561,567,564"\]

 

Even Roxy got to go for a ride today. She was a little nervous at first (so was I!), but she seemed to love it after the first few minutes and was even standing up on the edge of the basket. I can't wait to take her and the bike out tomorrow for a longer ride.
