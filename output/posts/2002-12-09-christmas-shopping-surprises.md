Christmas shopping this weekend was quite an adventure. All the stores were crowded, the roads were crowdedâ€¦. and I didn't purchase a single Christmas gift. I did, however, come home with a puppy.

PetsMart was sponsoring a local animal rescue and they had the cutest puppy. What else was I to do except bring him home? Comet has not quite decided if he likes this new addition to our family. He's very protective of me and things didn't go so well when puppy tried to steal a cookie from him this morning. The new puppy is adorable, but he's still adjusting. He's only 10 weeks old, so maybe it was a little ambitious of me to leave him in the crate overnight. That turned into a royal mess this morning. Today we've been doing good, we're scheduling his feeding and no playing until all business has been taken care of outside.

Puppy needs a name. I've been considering the following:

Orion (for the whole astronomy theme)

Strider (from LOTR, for those of you who don't know)

Chewie (because he likes to chew on things, also from Star Wars)

Astro (wasn't this the name of the Jetson's dog? I thought it would be cute to have "Comet and Astro")
