The Friday Five What was... 1. ...your first grade teacher's name? Normally, I'm known for remembering all sorts of trivia and minute details. But this one, well... I \*think\* it was Mrs. Garcia, and I'm sure my parents will probably remember and correct me if I'm wrong. 2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon? I loved the Smurfs and Fraggle Rock. It's a shame that they haven't released Fraggle Rock on DVD yet... Dance your cares away, Worry's for another day, Let the music play, Down at Fraggle Rock! 3. ...the name of your very first best friend? I would have to say Jessica who lived next door while we lived in Gilroy. We had the wonderful fun of overdosing on Flintstones Vitamins when I was 4 and going to the ER for a yummy coal milkshake. 4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal? Hmm. I don't recall the name of it, but it had some sort of Kix like puffs and chocolate covered marshmallows. 5. ...your favorite thing to do after school? Read. I used to check out 25 books at a time from the library, and sometimes I think it astonished my parents.... They would say "Now honey, only get as many as you can read in 2 weeks." I would read them all, especially during the summer. When I had the flu and missed a bunch of school in 3rd grade, I read the entire lit book...
