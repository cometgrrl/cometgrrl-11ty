_The Mirage_ by Matt Ruff

My rating:  3.75 / 5

I'm a big fan of Matt Ruff's other books, particularly _Fool on the Hill,_ so that's what initially drew me to this book.  Because, really, the premise of this book seems a bit far-fetched, even for me.

The story centers around an alternative history for 9/11.  Basically, it didn't happen.  Instead, what DID happen, is that on 11/9, American Fundamentalists hijacked planes and flew them into the "twin towers" in Bagdad.  Oh, and the middle east is the United Arab States, the world super power, and America is a bunch of religious zealots, terrorists, and a very unsafe in general.

I don't think this book is for everyone, but if you can take it with a grain of salt that this is supposed to be for entertainment, and in no way changes what actually did happen, you might enjoy it.
