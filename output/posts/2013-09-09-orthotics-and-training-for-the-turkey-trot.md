I went in last week for an orthotics casting. What this means is that they apply cast-like material to your feet to make a mold, and turn this into very custom insoles.

Hopefully these will help with my injures. We'll see in 3-5 weeks when they're ready.

Now that the Disneyland 1/2 marathon is over, I'm hoping that I can start (and complete) a training plan for the Turkey Trot. I'm running the Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5k, bright and early Thanksgiving morning. This is now a family tradition, and I will be joined by my husband (who hates to run, but has no choice on Thanksgiving), my mom, my step-dad, and one of my besties.

My training plan includes three runs per week. One "race pace" run, that is designed to practice running at the pace I want to run the race. I'm starting with 600m intervals and working up to 1000m. My second run each week is a speed workout. Most of these are sprint intervals with one or two tempo intervals in the mix. The last run for each week is an easy run. Conspicuously absent is a weekly long run.

Given my injuries, I made a decision to focus on speed and take a break from long runs for a while. The 5k mark is right about where I start feeling pain while running, and I think staying under that will be good.
