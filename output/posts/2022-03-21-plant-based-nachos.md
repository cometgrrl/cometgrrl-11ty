I ❤️ nachos and I order them any chance I get.

However, I hate the fact that often they aren’t vegetarian due to the refried beans, and the chips are always soggy or bare.

I decided to make my own plant-based nachos and see how they stack up to the competition.

It turns out, if you put the chips on the side, this solves the problem having soggy and bare chips! A nacho purist might argue against this, but I feel this is 100% needed improvement.

I’m pretty happy with how these came out, and would definitely make again.

### Plant-based nachos recipe

#### Ingredients

- Vegetarian refried black beans (Amy’s)

- Fire roasted diced tomatoes

- Plant-based cheese (Chao Mexican blend)

- Avocado

- Garlic - minced

- Lime juice

- Cilantro - chopped

- Plant-based sour cream (Sprouts)

- Hot sauce (Today I used Orange Sauce from La Vic’s)

- Tortilla chips

#### Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 375°

Layer in an oven-safe dish: refried beans, tomatoes, and then cheese.

Cover with aluminum foil and bake 10-15 minutes until cheese is melted.

While that’s baking, combine avocado, lime juice, garlic, and cilantro. Add salt if you like! I typically use 1 avocado, 1 teaspoon of lime juice, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, and a pinch of cilantro. Adjust lime juice depending on how ripe the avocado is.

When the cheese is melted, remove from oven, top with avocado mixture, sour cream, hot sauce, and additional cilantro.

Serve with chips on the side.
