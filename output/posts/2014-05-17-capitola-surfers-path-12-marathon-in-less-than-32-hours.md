I am super excited (and nervous) to race this weekend in the Capitola Surfer's Path 1/2 Marathon. Yes, nervous, very very nervous.

I haven't run as many long runs as I'd hoped. I've barely broken the 10k mark on a few occasions, and only one run over 7 miles.

There was a dip in my mileage the week I went to New York, but overall I'm fairly happy with my training. After this, I am going to focus on endurance, speed, and shorter distances!

Oh and I added to my shoe collection. The teal ones are going back. The Glycerin just isn't the right shoe for me, I am sticking with Ghost!  Now I have a replacement pair of Ghost 5's and a new pair of Ghost 6's!

Check back Sunday for a recap of my race!
