So, snowboarding in Jackson Hole was great........ right up until the point where I fell, twisted my right arm, and broke a bone in my elbow! Fortunately, I had Justin with me, and he made sure I made it down the mountain safely (snowboard and all). We're back now, and I'm taking it easy. I can't drive with my arm in a splint, so thankfully work is letting me work remotely this week. Next week, it's back to the grind. Coming soon -- Website updates!! It's hard (and slightly painful) to type with my arm like this, so it might take awhile, but definitely on the way!
