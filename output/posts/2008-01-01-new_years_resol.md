I'm only making one New Year's Resolution this year.... and that one resolution is to not make any damn resolutions this year. Everyone always makes these fabulous New Year's Resolutions... get in shape, lose weight, get a new job, get married... but how many of us actually keep them and accomplish them? How often are we lamenting in February how hard it will be to keep to those goals, and how often to we find ourselves failing? Here's a list of the most popular resolutions, and while all of those are fine things to resolve, I'd rather just DO IT, instead of making some silly resolution that I'll never keep simply because of the fact that it was a New Year's Resolution. Anyway, that's my tirade to start the new year. Happy New Year everyone!
