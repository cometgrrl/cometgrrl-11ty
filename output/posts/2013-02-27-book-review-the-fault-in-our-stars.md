_The Fault in Our Stars_ by John Green

My rating: 4 / 5

Hazel has terminal, stage IV thyroid cancer.  At 16, this means her life pretty much sucks.  But then she falls in love and has an adventure.

As Hazel says, "cancer books suck."  This is not just a novel about cancer, but a novel about being young.  About being young and in love. And yes, about being young and in love and dying. This book is gut-wrenchingly sad, heart-warming, and heartbreaking, all at the same time.

Despite being labeled as young adult, this book (obviously) deals with some mature themes (like dying from cancer).  I think some adults are often put off at the notion of reading young adult novels, maybe out of fear that the book has been dumbed down to satisfy a younger audience.  That is not the case with this novel.  The characters are 16, yes.  They have interests and hobbies that are typical of 16 year olds, but they are also well read, smart, witty and funny.
