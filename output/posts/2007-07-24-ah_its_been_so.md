Well, well, well. It's been quite a long time since there's been a post with any real content from me. So, now's the time to change that. First off, I went to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Friday. Good movie, but I guess I was expecting more action. I think, for me at least, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (#3) is still my favorite amongst the movies, while book 5 (Phoenix) has been the best book for me. And, since Amazon was so kind as to have USPS deliver Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (the final book, eep!) to my door over the weekend, I need to actively start reading that so I can post a mini review here. With that... I'm off to read.
