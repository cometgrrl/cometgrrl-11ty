It’s day two, and I will most likely not hit a gallon of water again today. I’m at about 80 oz. To reach a gallon, I’ll need to finish what’s in my water bottle PLUS drink one more full bottle (32 oz). It’s after 8pm and I’d really rather not drink a lot of water just before bed.

Yesterday, I made over 100 oz!!! This is amazing to me, as I’ve set goals to drink ~30 oz per day and failed miserably.

As I mentioned yesterday, I am shooting for a gallon per day, but I’m also ok with only a half gallon.
