2/27/2008 - another doctor visit It's Wednesday now, and after 4 days of not being able to walk, I am starting to think this is a very serious injury! As soon as Dr. Rush looks at my ankle, based on bruising and swelling, he says that he thinks it's highly likely that I have some sort of fracture. Especially once I tell him how the injury happened and mention that there's an anomaly on my initial x-rays He sends me off for "weight-bearing" x-rays from a completely different view point from the first set I had done on Monday. The first set were all with me laying down and turning my foot in different directions. I have to say, it's not that fun to get on and off a small step stool, and put weigh on an injured ankle. And yeah, it was broken!! All I had to say to my doctor on the matter was "I hope those x-rays were worth it to you, that HURT!" Anyway, yup, weight-bearing x-rays clearly showed a fractured talus bone. The only problem is, x-rays can only show so much, and without a better view, my doctor says he can't tell how bad the fracture is or if I'll need surgery. This means I have to get a CT scan, but those things take time to get an appointment. In the meantime, I was put in cast. Unfortunately, not a nice light fiberglass cast, but a BIG heavy plaster cast. It was better than nothing though, and clearly, I wasn't walking anywhere anyway. 3/4/2008 - CT scan 10 days after my injury, and I'm finally getting a CT scan. My doctor insisted they get me in ASAP, but even so, it still was a week later. I've never had an MRI, and I had never had a CT scan either. It's not that exciting, my leg went in a tube that rotated around and took lots of pictures. CT scan shows clearly that my talus is not only completely fractured, the fractured piece has rotated out of place and it's fractured slightly in another direction perpendicular to the main break. This, according to Dr. Rush, means 3 to 5 screws. 3 if he can get into to do the repairs easily, 5 if he has to saw off the malleolus of my tibia (the bony part that sticks out on the inside of your ankle), because that will take 2 additional screws to reattach. ![](images/n608716479_971641_6757.jpg)
