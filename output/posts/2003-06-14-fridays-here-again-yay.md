the friday five

1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?  
    Fall madly in love and know that I've found the one person I'll be with forever.
2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?  
    yes, but in a nice way… =)
3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?  
    Not really, nothing comes to mind.
4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?  
    I'd like to live in Hogsmeade… from Harry Potter. I think it would be cool to live in a place where magic is possible.
5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?  
    SING… I can't sing worth shit, but do anyway… it would be nice to be able to do it AND sound good!
