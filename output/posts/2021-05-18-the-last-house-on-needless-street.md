This is one of those books that's hard to write about without giving away too much. Murder mystery, as a whole, falls into that category, but this one is just extra.

I was very, very close to DNFing this book early on when Olivia was first introduced. I wasn't thrilled with an idea of a narrating cat, one who reads the bible and says G.D. all the time. Not that _actual_ swearing would bother me. However, I'm thrilled I continued due to the positive reviews.

There are clues, and I thought I had figured out a lot of the mystery, but holy cow. File this one under unreliable narrator 100x!

_The Last House on Needless Street_ is chock full of interesting, no fascinating, characters. Even if you don't like them or love them, they are really really bizarre and kept the book interesting and fresh at every turn.

My only negative comment is that while I enjoyed the audio version and the different narrators for various characters, I sometimes wanted to go back to check on the clues to the mystery. This is not the book's fault, of course, just something that nagged at me more than it has with other audiobooks.

★★★★

_I received a free copy of this audiobook from NetGalley.com and Macmillan Audio in exchange for a fair and honest review. All opinions are my own._

PS. This book isn't out yet, but you can pre-order it now. I believe it's coming out later this year, in September.
