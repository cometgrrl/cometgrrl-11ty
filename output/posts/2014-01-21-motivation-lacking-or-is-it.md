It's January, the fabled time of new year's resolutions. Often the only time said resolutions are kept, for some. So where's my motivation? Maybe it's vacation brain. I've only been to work for 1 day this year. Tomorrow is really the start of back-to-work for this year for me.

Now, I haven't exactly made resolutions, but I do have goals. It's a little early for an end-of-month goal check, but since this is January, let's go ahead and see how I'm doing.

Running: well, I've done 11.5 miles so far. A little behind, but I was on vacation for 2 weeks. :)

Yoga: I wasn't able to go to classes while on vacation, but I did follow a single short one online while I was gone, and I got my husband to start a 10-day yoga challenge with me.

Spanish: I set a goal in Duolingo to practice 5 minutes a day, and it says I've been on track for 32 days. I think some days I do more and some less, but it averages out. We've also moved up to Spanish 2, level 18. 13 more to go to finish the level.

Reading: While on vacation, I read a ton. 8 books, including 1 non-fiction, plus I am currently reading _A Short History of Nearly Everything_ by Bill Bryson.

I wish I had made a goal about volunteering. I volunteer with this really amazing dog rescue, DPS - Doggie Protective Services. Last year, due to illness, surgery, injury, travel, and work, I was unable to volunteer as much as I would have liked. This year, I would like to get back to it, as I love love love it.

Wait... who says the goals are written in stone? Time to add a volunteering goal! And guess what? Not only did I volunteer this past weekend, I got to foster an adorable little dog AND I made a donation so that a rescued dog (Rory) can get surgery for his broken leg.

Now that I'm actually tabulating my progress, it seems that I am doing quite well. I guess vacation was good for me!

I'll post the highlights of my New Zealand vacation in the next post, so check back!
