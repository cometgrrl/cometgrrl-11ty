hmmpt. this says adventures of cometgrrl and COMET, right?? so how come that pushy puppy gets to post first?

I'M THE OLDEST, and damn it, I'm CUTER. MUCH CUTER.

life just isn't fair. who said i even wanted a brother? he's mean, he pulls on my ears and my tail. i had to limp around for days just to get mommy away from himâ€¦. i liked it when she bought me a kitty, i wish we could trade him in for a new kitty.

licks and tail wags, Comet
