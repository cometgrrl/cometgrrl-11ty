Bailey is doing so much better! We've only had one accident in the house in the last few weeks (he's actually doing better than Comet who has regressed to jumping off the bed in the middle of the night to pee and then waking me AFTER because he wants to be put back on the bed).

This week we are still working on "down"…. he's gotten good, but he doesn't always respond to the word, but he's almost perfect with the hand command. "Leave it" and "drop it" are turning out to be a challenge, as Bailey likes to have stuff he shouldn't and he's not keen about returning things when asked.

I think he probably weighs in close to 30 lbs now… he has completely outgrown Comet's crate (25 lbs and under). We're on our way to Petsmart to buy a much bigger one for him tonight, one that is for 70 lbs and under (THANKS DAD!). I feel so bad for him, I didn't really notice until the last few days, but he can't even sit in the crate without ducking because he's too tall =( … I feel horrible and I think he'll be much more relaxed if he has more room to be comfortable when I'm not home.

Puppy class has gotten better too. I don't remember if I posted or not, but we thought our trainer was a bitch after the first night, but now she's become nicer and Bailey is allowed to play with all the other puppies!

Almost 6 pm… feeding time! After that, we're off to Petsmart. Do you know how much money I've spent at that place in the last month??! ……….. let's not talk about it.
