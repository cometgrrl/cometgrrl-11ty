My latest addiction: GameCube: Super Mario Sunshine

I've been addicted to Mario games for years. Ever since, way back when, my parents bought me my first nintendo, complete with Super Mario. There were 3 games in that Mario series, and I played every one to the last level and then some. The only Mario game I've missed was Super Mario Land, which was for the SNES. At the point in time that SNES arrived in the world, my parents felt that a) I had enough games and such and b) that I was getting a little old for video games.

Well, here we are in 2002 and I'm addicted to another Mario game. Seems my lack of a SNES system didn't quench my desire to spend hours running, jumping, and swimming as our lovable plumber, Mario.

Right now I have collected about 34 of the elusive "shine sprites" … if you don't understand, GET THE GAME. I think my 34 sprites, which involved hours of game-playing, are somewhere around 15-20% of the total.

Super Mario Sunshine: "How I spent my Thanksgiving vacation" …. really, I did other things as well, but this was the most fun. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves games, even if you are new to video games. (Gee, I sound like a Nintendo advertisement)

PS -- Comet likes it too. He's waiting for Nintendo to create a game controller that doesn't require opposable thumbs.
