Yesterday, a co-worker mentioned watching youtube videos of this famous Korean chef to keep occupied. He later sent me a link to a video of her making a veggie pancake, which looked pretty cool. (video is at the bottom of this post, fyi)

Anyway, I did not anticipate actually making the veggie pancake. Then I realized today that my green onions were about to go bad, and that I had enough flour to make the pancake (but not enough to really make anything else), and some other veggies to put in it. What the hell right? Let's try new things!

I've never really had a non-stick pan that was actually non-stick, so of course it stuck. And my pan is maybe 9" (she used a 12" pan in the video), so it was definitely too thick. I gave up trying to cook it evenly, keep it together, and flip, and just turned it into a scramble.

With no jalape√±o or serrano peppers to be found in my fridge, I had to make do with chili powder, which wasn't very strong. However, all in all it turned out tasty, even if it doesn't look correct.

So cooking fail? Or worthwhile experiment and learning experience? I got a decent meal out of it, so I'm happy with the outcome!
