I feel like I could kill Bailey this morning. He's been sleeping on the bed without problem for about the last week. I'm fairly certain he hasn't been hopping off the bed and peeing anywhere, because I wake up everytime he moves…

So last night, he had a lot of water at a late hour, so I put him in is crate for the night. This morning, I woke up to a wet smelly puppy. UGH. I didn't realize until I let him out and by then he was on the bed with his wet paws all over my sheets and then starting rolling around on my satin comforter.

I don't know if he did it because he really had to go (why didn't he cry?), or because he has in the past, but usually had a towel in there that would "hold" most of the mess so he could push it out of the way and stay dry.

Puppies can be so cute and yet so frustrating at the same time. Hopefully, he will only get better with time…
