Lately, I've been thinking a lot about health and fitness/exercise along with injury prevention. I've been injured recently and several of my friends have had torn ligaments, knee issues, stress fractures and shin splints.

I started running about 4 years ago, and last year really increased my mileage. Up until recently, I was injury free. And yet a year ago, I was told by a massage therapist to consider another sport. (Some people just don't get it, do they?) He felt that the high impact of running was bad given my ankle injury from 2008 (three screws in my left talus bone). With his apparent general dislike of running and his suggestion to "use the elliptical machine instead," it was easy to ignore his advice and to stop seeing him.

Well, turns out pretty much all the muscles in my legs are super tight and my hips are weak. The tightness is from a lack of stretching and the impact of running. The weak hips are a common problem and require special attention and some strength training exercises.

Since my knee injury in April, which turns out to be ITBS, I have been going to PT and doing research on injury prevention for running. ITBS is commonly caused by a tight IT band due to weak hips. The tightness all over in my legs probably exacerbates the problem.

I used to rock climb regularly, and I've been trying to do yoga at least once a week, but I have never been consistent with any sort of core, strength or stretching routines. This seems to be all the areas that need attention, if I am serious about injury prevention.

A few weeks ago, I posted some of what was recommended through PT. I have been trying my best to do those things daily, but it's tough (I've been traveling; first a vacation, then a 10 day business trip to Munich/Romania). In addition to those exercises and stretches, I'm also trying to follow this ITBS rehab routine that I found on strengthrunning.com. And on top of that, I want to start running again 3x/week, yoga 1x/week, and I'm doing a 30 day plank challenge. Oh, and I want to start a regular core exercise program 3x/week and stretching before/after running.

Maybe I'll even find time to sleep. And just because I love photos, here's a shot of the shorts I bought on my vacation. Perfect for my new core / strength / stretching routine!

QOTD: Have you been injured? What did you do for rehab? Anything special to prevent future injuries?
