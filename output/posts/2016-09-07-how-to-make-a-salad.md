Here's my handy guide to salad making.

**![IMG_2523](images/IMG_2523-226x300.jpg)Base** - start with a nice, tasty green base

examples: spinach, baby kale, mix greens, spring mix, but PLEASE not iceberg!

**Fruit** - I love fruit in my salads

examples: strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries or apple slices are some of my favorites

**Protein** - for me, a salad is not complete with some protein

examples: marinated tofu, white beans, chickpeas, black beans

**Seeds or nuts** - my version of croutons :)

examples: sesame seeds, pistachios, candied walnuts, sunflower seeds

**Spice it up!** \- If you like a little kick, add some!

examples: shallots, red onion, garlic

**Other** \- other fun things to add

examples: quinoa, cauliflower rice, corn, grape tomatoes, radish

**Avocado** \- goes with any salad if you ask me!

**Dressing** \- there's so many choices, my personal favorite is olive oil and pineapple white balsamic vinegar

Today's salad (pictured above):
