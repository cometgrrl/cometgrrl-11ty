Being injured really sucks. I've been unhappy with the progress, and had a follow-up with my orthopedic doctor last week, and he had me get an MRI. Now, I just have to wait for the results.

Honestly, I would love to run 50+ miles a month, but I just can't right now. One of the few good things right now is that my knee does seem to be getting better. I don't know if it's the physical therapy, the exercises and stretching program, or the time off from running last month.

In July, I ran absolutely 0 miles, and in August, only 16. In September, that number will be about 35. I've done 32 so far, and I have a 5k training run planned for tomorrow morning. I should probably just be happy that I was able to put in as many miles as I did this month. My average distance has also gone up from 2.3 miles last month to 4 miles this month. Of course, running a 1/2 marathon does sort of skew things.

Despite being injured, I did run two races this month.  The Disneyland 1/2 (which I should have skipped because my knee) and the Color Me Rad 5k. The concept of the Color Me Rad runs are interesting, but I don't know if I would run more than one of these types of runs per year. It's a fun run where you are bombarded with colored corn starch. It's loosely based on the Hindu Festival of Colors, which is also known as Holi.

What are your thoughts on fun runs? Like? Dislike?
