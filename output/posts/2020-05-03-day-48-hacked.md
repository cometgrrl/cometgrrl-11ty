My Hulu account was hacked! I got an email this evening saying I had a new login to my account... but I haven't used Hulu today, and certainly not on a new device, and definitely NOT from Stoney Creek, Ontario, CA.

Stupid SHIT HEADS. GET YOUR OWN HULU ACCOUNT! Also -- I thought Hulu was USA only?

Looks like I have a project tomorrow to change all my passwords and look into a more secure solution so I'm not using the same password on any two sites. I've gotten lazy over the years.

Ugh. Something I know I should be doing, but not how I wanted to spend my weekend. In the meantime, Hulu has been logged out of all devices and secured temporarily with a new password.
