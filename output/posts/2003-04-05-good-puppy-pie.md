Take one puppy, roll and play with him until slightly pampered,  
and add the following ingredients:

1 cup patience  
1 cup understanding  
1 pinch correction  
1 cup hard work  
2 cups praise  
1.5 cups fun

Blend well. Heat with the warmth of the heart until  
the consistency is such that the dog and handler are one.
