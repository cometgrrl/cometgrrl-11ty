the friday five 1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short? straight and long 2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime? the color is always changing, it's been permed, short, long, etc.... 3. How do your normally wear your hair? down, i don't like it up and i don't curl it 4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like? blonde with blue highlights and slightly curly =) 5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened? i tried to cut it myself once, it came out a little shorter, and totally uneven. i tied it up as best i could and played sick the next day before asking my step-mother to take me to get it fixed.
