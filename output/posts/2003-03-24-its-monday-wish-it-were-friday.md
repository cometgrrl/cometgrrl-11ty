the friday five

1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  
    Elvis -- that would just be too cool!
2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  
    I'd like to live in the future… maybe in a future where there's no war and cars are more like the little flying saucer cars from the Jetson.
3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  
    San Diego!!!
4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  
    Princess Buttercup from The Princess Bride. =)
5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  
    Hmm… Jennifer Aniston… or maybe Cameron Diaz?
