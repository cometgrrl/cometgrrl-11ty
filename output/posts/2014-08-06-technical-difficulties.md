I have been having technical difficulties with my current hosting provider... my husband!  Let's just say that having your blog hosted on a linux rack in the garage is not ideal if you have a husband who forgets that your website is hosted there and makes changes that break your DNS!

First it was a MySQL issue (it wasn't running, OOPS!), then it was removal of our static IPs, a conversion to IPv6, a server upgrade that broke resolution of my domain ONLY when I was at home....

So, now I'm up and running on Google App Engine.  We'll see how it goes!  I've got all my content moved over, now I just need update my theme and install all my plugins.  Once that's done, my domain (cometgrrl.com) will point over here!

Wish me luck, and please come back if you've come to my site and it was down.... it should be better now.... fingers crossed!
