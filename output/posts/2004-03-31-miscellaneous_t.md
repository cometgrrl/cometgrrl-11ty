"There's always a struggle to get to that which is best for you, but there's never a struggle for that which isn't." One of my best friends once told me that awhile back, and I really think it's true. I may complain that life is complicated, but I think I prefer it over boring. At least complicated gives me something more meaningful to think about other than what to cook for dinner or what TV show to watch tonight. And I've been in a surprisingly good mood lately, more so than I have been in quite some time I think. A few people have asked what to get me for my birthday, and off hand I don't have an answer, but there's a good place to get ideas: Amazon.com! And the last random thought of the day -- Ryan updated his site, it looks good.
