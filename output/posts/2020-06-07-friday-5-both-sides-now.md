1. **What side of you do people at work never see?** I try to show up with my whole self in everything I do. However, I guess at work I don't show my silly side so much.
2. **What will you be doing outside this weekend?** Reading, walking the dogs, enjoying the sun, and beautiful weather.
3. **What usual side dish do you frequently enjoy as an entree?** Mashed potatoes, artichokes, guacamole, and cauliflower. Not all together, obvi!
4. **What food that is flipped during cooking have you most recently consumed?** Quesadillas! YUM!
5. **Whatâ€™s recently been a thorn in your side?** COVID-19. World-wide pandemic, quarantine. Racism. Police brutality and use of excess force. The President who is dividing and ruining our country.
6. **Bonus question for people who can answer it: What album has a flawless B side?** For many years now, my music consumption has been digital, so I'm not sure I would even know what's considered B side theses days.

Brought to you by Friday 5.
