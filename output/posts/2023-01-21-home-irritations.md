The most irritating thing about my home is that it doesn't clean itself.

I'm a naturally messy person, and I hate cleaning. There's clutter everywhere, and a lack of places to put stuff, so it just stays where it's at.

I have been doing better about doing the dishes, although as soon as the dishwasher is full of clean dishes, it becomes a challenge again.

That said, I really do love my house.

Today's #Bloganuary prompt: **What irritates you about the home you live in?**

PS. Today's art is `a cartoon of a kitchen sink, filled with stacks of dirty dishes`.
