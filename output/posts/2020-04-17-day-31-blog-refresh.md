Way back in the day, I managed my website by directly writing HTML in a text editor and FTP'ing it up to the server.

These days, it's both easier and harder at the same time. Wordpress gives you a lot of features and flexibility. And depending on what you want, it can be very easy.

All I wanted, today, was to make the basic blog entry content font a bigger size. Maybe a different font style too, but definitely bigger. And I could not figure it out. It's buried somewhere in CSS and the overriding CSS I added didn't work. So I gave up, and changed to a completely different theme and organizational style. (Maybe I should read the CSS book that's been sitting on my (physical) bookshelf for about 10+ years.)

Now there's a static main page with a slide show of some of my favorite photos. I will definitely be adding and updating these over time! You can find the blog at the link at the top left, or by clicking on a link to any of the most recent posts from the main page.

Did even you notice a difference? If you came directly to the page for today's blog entry, you can get back to the main page here.

Any thoughts or comments on the new format?

PS -- it was bound to happen, this is actually day 32, not day 31. I"m tempted to stop numbering them, but I'm worried that will give me an excuse not to post every day.
