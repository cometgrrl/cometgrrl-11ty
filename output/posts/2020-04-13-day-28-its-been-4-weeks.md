Wow. It's been 4 weeks. Sometimes it feels more like years, but then everything is so blurred together.

I'd love to stick around and write more, but there's a new episode of Outlander on tonight, and can't miss that after the cliffhanger ending from 2 weeks ago. Of course, I read the books, so I know what happens, but still! Don't worry, no spoilers here. However, I will say that if you haven't seen Outlander (or read the books), I highly recommend it. I've seen season three times at this point, and the other seasons all twice. And I'm sure I'll watch them all again in the future.
