Is there anything worse than being awake at 3am and wishing you were asleep? Wishing you'd been asleep for hours already, because the alarm is going to go off at 6:30, and 3 hours just doesn't cut it?

That was last night for me. At some point, I realized that trying to get up at 6:30 and make it for an online gym class at 7 wasn't going to happen, so I set the alarm for much, much later, and after tossing and turning, finishing the book I was reading, and googling book themed tattoos, I FINALLY fell asleep.

Speaking of tattoos, I think I have a general idea of what I want. Now it's just a question of finding the right person to design it and do it. Know anyone good in the Bay Area?
