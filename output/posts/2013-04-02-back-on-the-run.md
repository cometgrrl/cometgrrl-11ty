On Saturday, I completed my first race of the year. I ran the Lagoon Valley 10K, and it was awesome! It was hilly (1042' total elevation gain) and slightly longer than 10K (6.44 miles vs the standard 6.25), but despite those things, I still pretty much made my goal. I set a very realistic goal of 1.5 hours before I realized that this was A VERY HILLY TRAIL RUN! My official time is just over 1.5 hours, and my self timed 6.25 mile time was 1:26:50. According to a handy calculator that adjusts for elevation, my "if it were flat time" is just 1 minute over what I ran for the 10K on the Bay last August.

This puts me at 1/6 towards my goal and 1/10 towards my stretch goal of 10 races.

I am already registered for a lot of other races this year, including:

- Santa Cruz 1/2 Marathon
- Rave Run 5K
- Nitro Valley 10K
- Disneyland 1/2 Marathon

And I'm not registered for the annual Turkey Trot 5K, the Santa Run, or Warrior Dash, but I would like to do those as well. That would put me at 8, so I guess I need to find 2 more races for this year!

I also managed to get in 30 miles in March, so I am at least on track to meet my easy mileage goal for 2013!
