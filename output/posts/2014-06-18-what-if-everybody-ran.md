I came across this neat statistical analysis done by Mizuno to see what would happen if everybody ran.

Some cool highlights:

- 63M Happier dogs!
- $143B in saved health care costs
- Up to 46% fewer homeless people

Even though the white paper states "As any good athlete would, we took some leaps of faith", I still find this amazing.

I can certainly say that my running has made one happier dog, and has made me happier and healthier.

What has running done for you? Is there anyone in your life you wish you could convince to become a runner?
