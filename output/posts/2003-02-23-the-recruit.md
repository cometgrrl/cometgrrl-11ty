I went to see _The Recruit_, starring Colin Farrell tonight. I highly recommend this movie. The storyline was engaging, the ending was a surprise, there's a nice twist. I don't want to ruin it, so I won't say anymore. Just go see it.

Oh yeah, Al Pacino and Bridget Moynahan were also very good in the movie. However, Ms. Moynahan could have worked a little harder to convince me that she's really CIA. I still picture her dancing on the bar (and brawling with the customers) in _Coyote Ugly_, as well as getting dumped by John Cusack in _Serendipity_.
