_#Bloganuary day 2: write about a road trip!_

I have never really been interested in taking a road trip. I did drive across the United States once when moving home from Maryland back to California. That was fun-ish? Brendan and I drove from North Carolina to Las Vegas in 3 days!

Until recently, I have not given another road trip much consideration. And then I read _Clanlands: Whisky, Warfare, and a Scottish Adventure Like No Other_ by Sam Heughan and Graham McTavish. I love all things Outlander, and this was no exception. The audiobook was delightful, Sam and Graham have an interesting dynamic, and the humor was entertaining. The book was followed up by a series on Starz, Men in Kilts. This added a visual look at the beauty of Scotland to the charms of Sam and Graham.

Outlander made me fall in love with Scotland, and _Clanlands_ gave me the push to want to visit and make it, at least in part, a road trip. I booked a trip for August 2021, which, unfortunately, I had to cancel due to Covid.

Fear not, faithful readers, I rebooked my ticket for this year. I am hopeful at this point that I won't have to reschedule, but we shall see. I am looking forward to seeing the Scottish Highlands, visiting an Irish pub (or two!), and relaxing along the coast of Lisbon.

If I make it this year, I will be sure to post lots of photos!
