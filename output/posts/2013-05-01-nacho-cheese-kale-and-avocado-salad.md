The photo (which has since been lost) is really terrible but I wanted to share. Kale, avocado and white beans topped with nacho cheese dressing, pumpkin seeds, almonds, pistachios and some "salad booster" which I think is primarily spirulina and chia seeds. I am in love with nacho "cheese" kale chips lately and I thought using the leftover "cheese" to make a salad dressing was pretty clever. And it was super yummy!

Oh and that's a chocolate-peanut butter-banana-coconut smoothie on the side. :)
