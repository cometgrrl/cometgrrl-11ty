I am queen of procrastinating when it comes to home improvement projects. For example, I bought an expensive art piece for my living room in 2018, and I just hung it up _yesterday._

In my defense, I had planned out a spot for it which required a sequence of furniture moves, this goes into that room, that goes into the garage. And then I'd need a new something too, to tie the wall together, and to not have a giant art piece with nothing underneath it. And all of that got put on hold last year because we were working on the bathroom remodel.

And now, I have my home office set-up there on that wall, and the art is too big to go above the computer monitor. So I decided to find a new place for it.

What do you think? Does it need to go higher? I put it as high as I could while standing on a chair and doing this all by myself.
