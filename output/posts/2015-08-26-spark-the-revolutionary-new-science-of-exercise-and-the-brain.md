![Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](images/721609.jpg)This book was really fascinating. As I've gotten older, I have certainly come to appreciate exercise more, and to cultivate a strong habit (or at least make an attempt).

Here are some highlights of the data presented in the book:

- Exercise can improve your brain function and learning
    - students that did cardio in the morning before school did better in english class than students that did not exercise 
    - students who had english immediately after exercise did better than students that exercised but had english class later in the day
- Exercise can improve your mental health
    - depression, stress, anxiety, ADD/ADHD can all (to some extent) be lessened/improved by exercising
- Exercise can prevent / delay symptoms of neurological disorders Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
- The current public health guidelines for exercise are probably too low. _"Americans are so inactive that the experts are wary of providing guidelines that are too stiff, for fear that the whole country will give up"_

If you are looking for motivation to exercise more, or to start exercising, I highly recommend reading this book. As a whole, our society could certainly stand an increase in physical exercise, and it seems as though all the mental health benefits would also be a positive!

After reading this, I've tried to pay more attention to how I feel immediately following exercise, throughout the day after, and on days that I don't exercise. And what I've noticed is that I have more energy on the days I run in the morning, despite getting up earlier to fit it in. I'm also a little less stressed (and more patient on those days). Oh, and if I don't run at all for a few days, I can definitely see a difference there too. Right now I have a broken toe, and I haven't been able to run for over a week, and it's been tough coming up with alternative things to do. It's nice to do yoga again, but it's not the same level of intensity.

What exercise do you enjoy?
