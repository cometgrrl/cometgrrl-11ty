\[Warning: linked reviews contain movie spoilers!\] So, I was going to write a review of _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_, but then I read this review by Jesus over at Gizmodo. He sums up pretty much almost every issue I had with the movie, and the issues that he did miss, were covered in this great review by David. I really can't say anything more, except that David totally stole my line about there being only 3 Indiana Jones movies. We were discussing the fact that Amazon has the original three Indiana Jones movies for sale as a DVD box set, and he said "Well, it's not a complete set now is it?" to which I replied "Yes it is, as far as I'm concerned, there's only three Indiana Jones movies."
