I've been meaning to start blogging again, and since it's January, it seems like the perfect time to kick myself and start writing.  Rather than writing an introduction, I was going to start off by writing about my new year's resolutions. But then I thought about how resolutions never seem to last past January.  So, this year, let's call them goals and not resolutions.  Aren't resolutions sort of made to be broken, anyway?  It will be a lot more motivating to me to have _goals!_ 

- _Resume blogging!_
    - _ha! this one is already done!_
- Run more miles than 2012 (314)
    - easy: 315
    - stretch: 500
- Run more races than 2012 (5)
    - easy: 6
    - stretch: 10
- Make progress on learning Spanish
    - easy: complete Fluenz Spanish level 1 (only 1-2 lessons left)
    - stretch: complete Fluenz Spanish levels 1, 2, AND 3
- Make progress on learning Romanian
    - easy: ??
    - stretch: ??
- Read more of the "classics"
    - easy:  finish Les Miserables![](images/ir?t=cometgrrlcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002RI9WMA)
    - stretch:  finish Les Mis, plus read On the Road, Anna Karenina, The Catcher in the Rye, and Lolita.

I am pretty certain that I can complete the miles, races, classics, and possibly Spanish (certainly the easy goals, at least).  Romanian, on the other hand, seems to be the thing I'm least likely to do -- I'll have to push myself.
