_Real Americans_ by Rachel Khong is a multi-generational novel that centers on American identity and the theme of nature vs. nurture.

The novel starts with Lily Chen and tells the meet cute story of how she meets and falls in love with Matthew. I found this part of the novel the most enjoyable.

Unfortunately, we then jump forward in time and follow Nick Chen as he struggles with feelings of not belonging. As we follow Nick, desperately seeking his place in the world, we meet May, Nick's grandmother, and Lily's estranged mother.

This introduces another time shift. Here, we learn how May and Charles fled from Mao's Communist China and ended up in America.

Going back in time loses momentum in the story. Also, at this point, I don't really care about the story or the characters. I just want it to be over.

Others may enjoy this more than I did. It's not a bad book, but it's not one that I loved either.
