Recommended to me as "powerful and dangerous", _Influence_ explains why we say yes when we know we shouldn't.

There are many examples, studies, and clear explanations.  The author even offers up ways to combat what he calls "compliance practitioners" -- the people who are using these tactics against us.

The table of contents includes things like "Weapons of Influence", "Liking: The Friendly Thief" and "Commitment and Consistency: Hobgoblins of the Mind".

I found this book very informative and interesting. I felt there were some eye opening psychology learnings applicable for every life.

If you've ever felt swindled by a car dealer or a sales person shortly after buying something or been talked into doing a favor that you really didn't want to do, then this book would probably be of interest to you.

For example, did you know that when someone calls you to solicit a donation, they often start with small talk like asking how you are doing? Do you know why? Most people will answer that they are doing well so now is the solicitor's opportunity to tell you about someone or something that isn't doing well (say orphans in Africa) and ask you to donate. After just having said you were doing well, it makes it much harder to say no.

The book also talks about social proof and why, in an emergency, you would be better off with one bystander to call for help vs a crowd. Advice in this section could b life saving.
