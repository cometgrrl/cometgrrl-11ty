My Rating: 2.75 / 5

Mindy Kaling first caught my attention as Kelly Kapoor on _The Office._  Since then, I've have learned that she started as a writer, and even produced and directed several episodes.  She now has her own tv series, _The Mindy Project,_ which is one of my favorite new comedies.

Her book, however, was just ok.  There's some funny stories, and the feeling that she's confiding in a close friend as she relays anecdotes and thoughts about her life.  I was really expecting it to be over the top funny, and while there are a few funny parts, it's mostly boring.  (Sorry Mindy!)
