I just finished reading _Know My Name_ by Chanel Miller.

I don't have the words right now to properly respond to the book. It's late and Chanel's memoir touches all sorts of emotions. Tomorrow, or this weekend, when the sun is shining, I will write a proper post about it.

In other news, I'm probably going to stop numbering the posts. It was keeping me accountable at first, but I had no idea it was going to be for this long and now it just seems kind of silly.

Now back to reading Moby Dick!
