#Bloganuary day 6: write about someone who inspires you.

Who inspires me? Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. I'm sure my friends won't be surprised by this answer.

He is such a nice person, and incredibly generous and hardworking. He often says "while it's nice to be important, it's more important to be nice". Oh, and despite all his fame, he is still a very humble man.

If you aren't familiar with his background, I recommend reading what you can about him. I am always impressed by his story, and how he was able to overcome setbacks in life to become _the sexiest man alive_, and one of the most liked people in the entire world.
