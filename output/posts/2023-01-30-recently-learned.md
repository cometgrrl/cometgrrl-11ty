Today’s #Bloganuary prompt: **What is something you recently learned?**

Ironically, something I recently learned is that I don’t like blogging every day to prompts.

I’d rather be writing book reviews, recapping my favorite books from 2022, or telling y’all about how I joined a gym.

Alas, there’s only a few days left for #Bloganuary, so I am sticking with it!
