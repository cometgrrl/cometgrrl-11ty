_Speaking from Among the Bones: A Flavia de Luce Novel_ by Alan Bradley

My rating:  5 / 5

Flavia de Luce is an 11 year-old amateur detective with a passion for chemistry and an eccentric family.  Despite living in a sleepy english village, known as Bishop's Lacey, Flavia somehow manages to find herself enmeshed in yet another murder.

This is the 5th book in the series, and thus the 5th murder investigation for our heroine, Flavia.  Set in the 1950's, there are no cell phones, computers or anything more technologically advanced than a standard landline phone.  And even that is off limits except for emergencies in Flavia's home, Father's orders.

I have thoroughly enjoyed each book in this series, and am quite happy that the series continues to be excellent.  I wasn't sure when I read the first one if I would enjoy a detective / mystery series with an 11 year old as the protagonist, but I have to say that Flavia is a very well written character and that her age does not detract from the story in any way.
