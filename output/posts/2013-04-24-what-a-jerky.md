I really wanted to share an awesome vegan recipe this week. I've tried to converge on a theme for my blog, and originally I was thinking "running & reading" but there was something missing. I love food, and for whatever reason, I'm addicted to taking photos of food. So, now you will start seeing more posts related to vegetarian and/or vegan food and, more generally, animal rights. (I'll post more about that later.)

Anyway, turns out I don't have a good recipe to share this week, but I do have an awesome vegan food product to share. This is not a sponsored post and I did not receive any food for free (unfortunately).

Since becoming vegetarian, I have found that a lot of fake meat products are really, well, gross. Part of being vegetarian is about NOT wanting to eat meat, but there are still some things that I miss. One of these things is jerky. I was picky about it then, and it turns out I'm still picky about it now.

Prior to this morning, I had only tried one brand of vegan jerky, Primal Strips. Then, this morning I received a box of assorted goodies that I ordered from Spencer's Market. Inside was a package of Ned's Spicy Chipotle Jerky from Morels the Vegan Butcher. It looked so tasty, I decided to open it immediately and try just a bite. Well, five minutes later, the entire package was gone.

I am in love. The slogan on the package sums it up well, "What a Jerky!!" It tastes great, it's got the right texture, but I don't ever have to worry about gristle or it being undercooked (ick). It's got some kick, and if you know me, you know how I like my spicy food! The only thing that would make it better would be non-GMO soy beans. (I've already contacted Morels through the website to ask. See update @ end for their reply!)

Primal Strips aren't even in the same class as Ned's. I've tried a few flavors from Primal and can't say that I would buy it again. It's wet and slimy, and tastes like fake meat. Ned's, however, might even fool some non-veg folks. I'll find out when I get some more (which, of course, I've already ordered).

I regret not getting any close up photos of the jerky itself, but well, you'll have to forgive me. I was too busy eating it to think about photos.

**Update:** I got an email back that says the jerky is GMO free! Here's what it said:
