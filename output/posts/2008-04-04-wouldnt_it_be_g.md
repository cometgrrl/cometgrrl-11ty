"Wouldn't it be great if there was a way...." That's what I kept hearing as I was trying to finish Portal, a very neat video game from from Valve, that comes as a part of the Orange Box. Silly me, I kept running around the levels in a semi-confused state, rather than using portals to be faster and more efficient, and David kept reminding me of this. I also kept forgetting the concept of portal physics / gravity, which, while quite useful, took me some time to master, as it's somewhat different from what I'm used to here on Earth. The basic premise of Portal is that you're running through a set of test chambers and learning about (and how to use) Portal guns. The guns allow you to create a set of portals, and teleport around within the test chambers and you're required to solve puzzles involving the placement of the portals (among other things). Only certain surfaces will allow portal placement, so this makes it kind of tricky at some points. I found it to be very fun and quite humorous. Without giving the ending away, I will just say that if you've played this game but haven't finished, YOU SHOULD. The ending was just great. If you haven't played at all, YOU SHOULD. Check it out, it's fun. Oh, and don't forget... the cake is a lie!
