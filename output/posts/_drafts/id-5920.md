The title of this post brings back memories of The Lion King, and the Elton John song from the movie's soundtrack. This is actually not my intention, but alas, I am stuck in finding a better turn of phrase.

While in the Galápagos, we were surrounded by nature. And I got to see, UP CLOSE, so many incredible things–Galápagos penguins, sea lions, dolphins, frigatebirds, blue-footed and red-footed-boobies, marine and land iguanas, sea turtles, tortoises, and more!

I've been vegetarian bordering on vegan for 12+ years because I refuse to be responsible for the animal suffering that comes with eating them. I'm used to the sight of my own blood (clumsy as I am), and yet I get faint at the sight of an injured or dead animal.
