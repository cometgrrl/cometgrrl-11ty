I started this post in 2013 and never finished it. Sometimes I think I'm crazy to even think about this, and other times, well, I THINK ABOUT THIS!

At first, it was just a crazy idea. An only-in-my-head-crazy-but-real-never-to-be-spoken-out-load idea. Mostly, it was CRAZY. And something that I didn't really think I would actually do.

And then I had the thought that I should do it. I've been pushing my mom to run a 10k, to consider a half, and I keep telling her "What's the the worst that could happen? You might end up going for a long walk!" So if that's my advice to her, what's my advice to myself about a full marathon?
