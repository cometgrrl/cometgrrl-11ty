I have finally scanned and uploaded all the postcards from the road trip. I even put them in a nifty photo gallery that you can view here. I missed getting a postcard in North Carolina, I didn't like Arkansas and so I skipped that state intentionally, and I was too poor in Las Vegas to afford one from Nevada. Oh yes, and the Arizona postcard got ruined.
