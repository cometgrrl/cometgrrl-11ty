The Bloganuary prompt for January 14 was to write about a challenge faced and overcome.

I'm going through all the Bloganuary prompts I missed or skipped in January, so you'll see these popping up over the next few weeks (months?).

This is a really tough prompt. It feels as though it warrants a challenge of substance and not something trivial like I got a speeding ticket and went to court, and got out of it. However, all the substantial challenges I can think of are monumental and quite emotional. There's the challenge of going through my parents' divorce, and dealing with the fallout. Then there's the not getting into the university I wanted, dealing with the death of my beloved Comet, my own divorce...
