Man arrested over peace T-shirt _(note from the future: the link doesn't work anymore)_

_A man was charged with trespassing in a mall after he refused to take off a T-shirt that said "Peace on Earth" and "Give peace a chance."_

What is our country, which was founded on civil rights and liberty, coming to? I cannot believe that someone was arrested for wearing a pro-peace shirt. And now they say he was arrested "for not leaving the mall" -- which is bogus. Wasn't he asked to leave because he wouldn't remove his shirt. It all comes down to the same thing -- they didn't like his shirt or his message and they were trying to censor it.

I really hope that the judge that gets this case throws it right out the door.
