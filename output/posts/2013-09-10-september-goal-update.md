I realized it's been quite a while since I did a goal progress check.

- Run more miles -
    - last year at this time, I was at 187 miles.
    - so far this year, I've done 200. :)
- Run more races -
    - last year 5
    - this year 2 so far, but I have three, maybe four more scheduled  - Color Me Rad on 9/14, Turkey Trot, and the Santa Run.  I might also do the "ugly sweater run."
- Spanish -
    - I'm on lesson 9/30 in Spanish 2.  Not going as fast as I'd hoped because I'm doing it with my husband.
- Romanian -
    - hardly any progress :(
- Reading more "classics"
    - I finished Les Mis, and read The Catcher in the Rye, but I haven't read (or even started) On the Road, Anna Karenina, or Lolita

I guess I better get start reading more classics and start doing more language practice. If anyone wants to come tudor me, that would be awesome.
