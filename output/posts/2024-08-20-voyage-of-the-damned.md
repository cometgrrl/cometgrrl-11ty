_Voyage of the Damned_ by Frances White is an LGBTQIA murder mystery full of magical beings, intrigue, and suspense.

While overall, I enjoyed the story, this one has many issues. First, it's billed as adult fantasy, but reads more like YA to me. Second, the world-building is all over the place, or more aptly, full of holes, as is the magic system.

At times, I wanted to empathize with our main character, Dee. At other times, I wanted to smack him for being so self-absorbed and lacking in any sort of self-confidence.

There are also a lot of references that seem out of place, like hot dogs and poutine. What are these doing in this magical world?

I considered putting this down several times, but ultimately, I felt compelled to see how it ended. Somehow, the ending managed to be both satisfying and a let-down.

★★★
