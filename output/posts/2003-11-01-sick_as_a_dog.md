My halloween was spent taking Comet to the vet and trying to return a rental car while carrying a sick dog, all my junk that had accumulated in the rental... and finding out that, while they fixed the damage to my car from the insurance claim, they didn't fix the vandalism on the trunk of my car. All in all it was a rotten day. Poor Comet... mom's husband poured bacon grease out in the dirt in front of the house on Thursday and both the dogs were out there eating it. But what they really ate was a lot of dirt, twigs, and little rocks. Bailey, being much bigger, is fine. Comet, however, was very sick. I just knew he wasn't feeling well. At the vet's office, he got an enema, x-rays, an antibiotic shot, an anti-vomitting shot, and some medicine. He seems to be doing much better now, but he still has some rocks in his little tummy that need to come out... I hope he's not in any more pain. I really do enjoy being back in California, but it's starting to wear on me. Not being here, but living at home, not knowing a lot of people around here anymore, and not having a job. And I'm sort of sick of people in general, or maybe it's just guys. I feel like I'll always date the wrong guys, that anyone that I'm close to will turn out to be a jerk. It's the story of my life, why would I think moving back here would change anything?
