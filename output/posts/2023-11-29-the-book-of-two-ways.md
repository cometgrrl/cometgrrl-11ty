_The Book of Two Ways_ by Jodi Picoult is yet another book featuring infidelity.

I'm not really sure if I liked it or not. I didn't really care for the characters, but I found parts of the plot interesting.

What I loved:

- Learning about The Book of Two Ways and Egyptology in general.

- Dawn's work as a death doula and her friendship with her client Win.

- Quantum mechanics and discussions of Schrödinger's cat and the multiverse.

What I didn't love:

- The alternating timelines. It was confusing. Is this now? The past? Boston? Egypt? I understand why the narrative device was chosen, and appreciate the twist at the end, but there could have been better signaling of when/where the story was at.

- The infidelity.

- The implausibility of Dawn and Wyatt.

- Dawn's actions, which really did not seem to match what we're told about her character (selfless, loving, etc.)

★★★

Recommended if you love Egypt, mummies, or anything about Egyptology.
