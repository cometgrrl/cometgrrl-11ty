This was one of my favorite places in Galápagos.

Since I wasn't feeling well, I missed the Friday morning excursion at Playa Las Bachas. However, it's hard to be sad, or have a bad day when you wake up to this view!

While others were snorkeling, a few of us went out in the "glass bottom" panga, to look for penguins. And we found lots!

After seeing the penguins, we took a hike to the top of Isla Bartolomé. There's a boardwalk-style ramp with around 400 steps to get to the top. It seems like a lot, but it turned out to be totally worth it (and not that hard).

Isla Bartolomé is one of the younger islands in the Galápagos, and pretty barren. It almost feels like being on Mars. You can definitely tell this is an island of volcanic origin.

The water here was so pretty, this lovely cerulean color.

And at the end of the day, another fabulous sunset.
