![](images/7875327.jpg)_Dead Beautiful_ by Yvonne Woon

A paranormal romance, _Dead Beautiful_ tells the story of Renee Winters, and what happens when she is sent away to boarding school after the death of her parents.

Overall, I enjoyed this book, but for a paranormal romance, I think it took way too long to dig into what, exactly, was paranormal. Possibly because it took so long, there were lots of clues and the big reveal was not much of a reveal for me. I won't spoil it for you here, but if you read it, see if you can't spot it waaaay in advance.

The other down side to this book was that I felt the writing wasn't stellar. It was OK, but a little too wordy and a little repetitive in places with adjectives and information.

That said, I will still probably continue with the series, at least one more, to see if the writing improves.

_Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this through NetGalley, in exchange for a fair and honest review._

★★★
