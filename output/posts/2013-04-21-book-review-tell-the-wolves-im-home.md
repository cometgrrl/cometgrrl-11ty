Set in the mid 1980's, this novel tells the story of 14-year-old June, who loses her uncle, Finn, to AIDS.  Finn was not only her uncle, but her godfather, companion, and best friend.

This is a sad story, and really illustrates how little was known about AIDS at that time.  It's heart-breaking to think about how much people suffered unnecessarily and how scary it must have been when there was really no clear information on how AIDS was transmitted.

I don't want to say too much more about the plot of the novel, but I really enjoyed this.  The characters were vivid and interesting, and the story very touching.  Unlike some other novels I have read recently, I thought the perspective of June, at age 14, was well done.
