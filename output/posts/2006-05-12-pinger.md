So I finally ditched the job in Monterey, and got a fancy new job working for Pinger! I've been here for a month now and really like it. It's unbelievably nice to drive only 7 miles to work instead of 80. Justin finally had his surgery last month, and he's doing great! We're still addicted to FFXI, and all my short term goals from the last post have been done! Almost to level 40 with BLM, and Justin is working on BLU. He caught up to me during his time off following the surgery, and now we're staying together at the same level, it's been fun! Coming soon -- -------> pictures of the new place and stuff (once I move in!)
