Last year, I went to the ER at 4am. I'd been having chest pain for about 10 hours, cold sweats, nausea, couldn't sleep.

After 4 hours at the ER, they said I wasn't dying. No signs of a heart attack or any lung issue like pneumonia. Go see your primary care doctor, byeeeeee!

After seeing a primary care doctor, I ended up with a prescription for pantoprazole. I took it for about a week. I stopped because a) the chest pain went away and b) I thought I was having liver pain and I've had a bad reaction to Rx drugs like that before. I was traveling out of the country at the time, so not much else I could do.

This was all in October. I've been very very happy the chest pain didn't return. I thought maybe it was anxiety related and it was gone for good.

Until this week.

And tonight, acid reflux soooo bad. I can't stop coughing, I want to puke. Ugh.

I'm out of tums, I already took Pepcid AC today, pepto, and the Prilosec I got today says to take every 24 hours in the morning before eating.

It's ruining Ed Norton movie week!

In all seriousness, I'm not dying. I know there are people all over the world who are worse off. Licorice tea with honey seems to be helping.

I'll have a better post this weekend about Know Your Name.

I'll leave you with this -
