Have you ever had a training run where it seemed like everything went wrong? That was my experience tonight.

First it was my stomach, and I almost didn't run, but I'd been telling myself all day that I wouldn't skip it. And that ended up being fine. But then my  new custom orthotics seemed too narrow for my shoes (and it turns out I think they don't work in that pair of running shoes). Then my shoes were laced too tight. And my pants were too loose. It was hot in the garage (where my treadmill is) so I had to stop to open the window. It was getting dark, so I stopped again to turn on the lights. Then my leg was itchy. And my shoes were still too tight. Oh, and these are not the shoes I wanted to wear, oops!

The final thing was when I noticed the treadmill belt was shifted to left, of course I had to stop, locate the instructions, adjust the belt, run a minute, check, adjust, run and so on, until it was centered again.

Now I'm done, and I have a blister. The orthotics do seem narrow but they look like they fit much better in my Sauconys which are the shoes I meant to wear tonight.

The good news? I ran 2.25 miles which was my target, my knee doesn't hurt, and nothing super serious actually went wrong. 

Sometimes I feel like my brain wants to trick me into not running, and I have to just push through and do it anyway. This is actually why running in the morning is best for me, less chances to talk myself out of it, as long as I can get out of bed in time!

I have 7 weeks left to train for my next half marathon (Capitola!!!) and I want to make the most of those weeks.
