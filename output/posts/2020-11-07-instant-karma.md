I picked this up because I absolutely adore Marissa Meyer's Lunar Chronicles series. And guess what? It did not disappoint! While it's not the greatest book in the universe, I really enjoyed it. That's what it all comes down to, isn't it?

It’s cute and endearing if a tad predictable. Great beach read or a good listen for a road trip. Yes, our main character Prudence is self-centered and judgemental, but she wants to be better. In fact, she does try to be better and even learns some life lessons over the course of the plot.

Now, it's fairly obvious in some places what will happen. The novel follows a fairly standard rom-com narrative with introducing the couple, them finalizing realized what we've known all along (they _like_ each other!), some sort of fight/split, and a reunion at the end. Don't let that spoil it for you!

The things I loved:

- Prudence learning that her judgemental attitude is not serving her as well as she thought, and her judgments are often wrong and hurtful.
- The sea rescue!
- Quint - until I didn't.
- The narrator - I listened to the audio version and felt she did a great job.

Things I didn't love:

- The obvious way Prudence was doing things wrong, but that was part of her journey, I suppose necessary for the book to happen.
- The instant karma device - I'm not sure it was necessary, but I guess it worked ok? Also, it would be something kind of cool to have personally, but Prudence just _didn't get it_ for almost the entire book.

Overall, as mentioned at the start, this is a great beach read, or for any day when you don't want to read something serious or heavy.

★★★★
