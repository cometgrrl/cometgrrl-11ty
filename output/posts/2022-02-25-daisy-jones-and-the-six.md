People like this book. People LOVE this book. O.M.G. I do not understand why.

_D__aisy Jones and the Six_, by Taylor Jenkins Reid, uses a rock documentary narrative device. Everything is told as though from transcripts of the documentary interviews. I listened to the audiobook, and while I didn’t enjoy the format, it’s a neat idea.

I don’t like books with too many points of view unless there’s a really clear need. _Game of Thrones_, for example, needs this to tell us the events happening simultaneously across Westeros and Essos. And there is a LOT happening in GoT, unlike in _Daisy Jones,_ where for the most part, there's not much happening.

Additionally, I found it hard to follow, despite different voice actors for each character. Most characters seemed shallow and poorly developed. I didn’t care what happened to them or how they were feeling. There were too many minor characters, with little influence on the overall story.

It’s a typical rock ‘n roll story of sex, drugs, and alcohol. Most people can see the crash and burn coming from miles away.

It’s rare for me to feel this strongly—and this negative—about a book. This is the most hyped, overrated book since The Midnight Library. I do not recommend this book or understand the appeal at all.
