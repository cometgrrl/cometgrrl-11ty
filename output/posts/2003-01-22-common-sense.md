Judge dismisses McDonald's lawsuit

At least some people still have common sense. _Of course,_ McDonald's is bad for you. It's greasy, nasty, fatty, fast food. You can't sue them for that, it's not like they claim to be healthy food, or healthy, or even low-fat.

Americans need to lay off the "I'm stupid, so I'm going to sue" mentality. How much did that woman get for her coffee being hot? IT WAS COFFEE! DUH!
