the friday five 1. What were your favorite childhood stories? I loved _The BFG_ and _James and the Giant Peach_. 2. What books from your childhood would you like to share with \[your\] children? All my favorites, there are so many good children's books. 3. Have you re-read any of those childhood stories and been surprised by anything? I re-read the Narnia Chronicles. When I was young, I hadn't noticed the religious theme of the books. 4. How old were you when you first learned to read? I don't remember! I was probably in kindergarten. 5. Do you remember the first 'grown-up' book you read? How old were you? I read a lot of 'grown-up' books when I was young, but the one that strikes me is _Hasan_, (or was it _Mute_?) by Piers Anthony. My mom bought it for me, as Anthony was recommended by a friend of hers. I think at that age, 11 or so, I could have done without the steamy sex scenes. Anthony's other works, such as the Xanth series, are really more kid friendly.
