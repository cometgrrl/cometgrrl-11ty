Vega invited me to be a part of their #OneChangeÂ campaign. It just takes #OneChange to start a new habit, so why not start a Vega habit?

I have a horrible habit of skipping breakfast, and then drinking a soda or energy drink instead, because I can't make it until lunch on a completely empty stomach. One of my goals this year is to be better about that, and I know that Vega products will be a part of this change.

With Vega One, it's really easy to make a nutritious yet tasty breakfast in a matter of seconds. You can mix it with water, soy/almond/coconut milk and go. If you have a bit more time, it makes a great protein addition to a smoothie.

As part of the campaign, Vega sent me free samples of Vega One French Vanilla. This is fabulous for adding to a smoothie as the vanilla flavor goes well in almost any smoothie combo. One my favorite and easiest to make smoothies is a almond milk, frozen berries, a banana and a scoop or so of Vega One.

Also, when I travel for work, it's very hard to find breakfast that's appealing to me. I usually travel to Romania up to 4 times a year, and all the hotels offer breakfast, but it's all bread and meat/cheese. As a vegetarian and "vegan in training", this is not the most appealing breakfast for me. I usually bring along a shaker cup and some Vega One, and I can make a healthy breakfast right in my hotel room using the complimentary bottled water.

I will definitely be taking my free samples with me on my next trip, which happens to be next month!

Question of the Day:

What do you normally eat for breakfast?
