Working 50 plus hours a week (and not getting paid for the extra time) really does NOT agree with me. I am soooo ready for a vacation. Too bad our VP has limited all time off through the end of June… I haven't had a single day off this year not counting paid holidays and sick days…. and I've even been working on Saturdays. They really don't pay me enough for this shit.

I've been so busy, I haven't posted much lately…. Some recent news:

- I finally saw _Dreamcatcher_ -- main dissapointment was the radical changes to the ending, but overall it was good.
- Also saw _Anger Management_ and _A Man Apart_. I thought _A Man Apart_ was great, altho the ending was less than spectacular. They could have done something a little more interesting, or surprising.
- _The Fountainhead_ has taken me longer to read than I expected. I love this book, and wonder why I didn't read it sooner. It's different from what I normally read, but I'm still eager to continue reading it. I might post a review when I finish.

Hopefully I'll have more to post soon!
