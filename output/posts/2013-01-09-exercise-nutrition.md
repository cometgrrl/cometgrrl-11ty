24 hours post cross-training (a functional strength training circuit designed for runners that I got from Pear, and I feel relatively un-sore, particularly compared to the previous workout (the same thing, **minus** the weights).  I believe I owe it all to a post-workout protein shake.  Gotta love Vega Energizing smoothies!

Based on this, I may need to think my normal exercise & nutrition routine.... which is, well none.  I often run first thing in the morning (or first thing after getting out of bed at least), on an empty stomach, and then don't eat or drink anything but water on my runs.  After a run, sometimes I will eat, typically not immediately after.
