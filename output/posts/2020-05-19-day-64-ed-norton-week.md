After watching Primal Fear last night, I decided this week's theme will be Ed Norton movies!

Tonight's movie - The Score with Robert De Niro.

Later this week - Rounders, American History X, and maybe The Illusionist or 25th Hour.

I'm trying to watch movies I haven't seen before so Fight Club, and Keeping the Faith are not on the list, even though I love both those movies.

Any Ed Norton movies you'd recommend?

I'll post later on and let you know which movies I liked and which ones I didn't.
