I'm finding it difficult to have interesting topics to blog about EVERY DAY!

Fridays are particularly difficult. It's the end of the week, and I just want to shut my brain off. If I'm smart, I'll schedule a book review or something else ahead of time for next week.

It doesn't help that on Fridays we have an office happy "hour" starting at 4, and on top of that, I'm invited to a "pre-gaming" meeting at 3. So, I've been drinking for about 6 hours now.

The Spazmatics are doing homeageddon show #3 tonight, and while that's entertaining, it's not the same as usual life -- being out and going out.

Sometimes I wonder if this blog is for me, or for you, dear reader. And in the end, I decided, it has to be for me, because I cannot know, or control, how you react,

However, I do have more content that is interesting in the works. So.... if you're not completely bored yet, keep reading and let's see where this goes!

Somehow, even though it's 2020, media upload to WP sucks. I apologize if my photos aren't displaying properly and I'm working with my hosting provider to figure this out.
