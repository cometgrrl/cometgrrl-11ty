I think getting a puppy was a little ambitious, even for me. Comet was six months old when he came home. And he was handful, even tho at that time, I had help. Bailey is now 11 weeks old. So he's full of energy, he's playful, he bites, he has to pee every hour…. not mention he seems to love tormenting Comet. I feel so bad for Comet, but then again, he seems to enjoy playing with Bailey…. but only when it's on his terms. Comet is still learning to share his (quite numerous and mostly unused) toys, his mom (me), and his "outside time."

We're all adjusting to having a puppy. If having kids is more work than a puppy, then I don't want any. I wanted to see LOTR - The Two Towers tonight with some people from work, but the show's at 10pm. And I thought to myself "It will after 5:30 before I get home. I have to walk Bailey, then Comet. Then I have to entertain Bailey for an hour, feed him dinner and try and cook myself dinner and eat in less than an hour. Then the dogs go out again." By the time 10pm rolls around, I'm quite tired. Bailey isn't.

I've only had Bailey for 10 days and right now, I could use a vacation. Just one night to relax and not chase a puppy around, and stand outside in this horribly cold, below 30 degrees weather says "go potty, go potty like a good boy…. dammit go potty!"

The puppy adventure tonight was an attempt at nail trimming. Howls and mock cries of pain the first nail. After about 75% of one foot, I gave up. I couldn't take the fake cries of pain, and my arm is still sore and bleeding from the scratches I received.

We're taking it day by day and I keep reminding myself that Comet was just like this when he was a puppy. Sort of.
