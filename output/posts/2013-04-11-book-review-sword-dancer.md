My rating:  3.75 / 5

This book was recommended by my SIL. Actually, she recommended the entire series.  I enjoyed this, but it's not the best fantasy book I've ever read.  I love fantasy novels, and I admit this genre is not for everyone.  However, most of this series is not available for Kindle, which is almost a deal-breaker for me.  If I had to pick a fantasy series to start reading (or continue reading),  I would certainly pick up where I left off in the Xanth Series by Piers Anthony, but that has the same problem.  The start of the series (which I've read) is available, and the most recent few, but not the ones in the middle that I haven't read yet!

Sword Dancer tells the story of Tiger and Del's first adventure. Tiger is a sword dancer, which we find out is a type of sell-sword. Del is a northern beauty, and very out of place in Tiger's desert. As Del is looking for her younger brother, who was stolen and sold as a slave many years earlier. With Tiger's help, she is able to navigate the inhospitable deserts and continue her quest.

If you enjoy fantasy, and don't mind getting it in paper back if you want to finish the series, I say go for it!
