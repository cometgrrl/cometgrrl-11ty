I started writing this Saturday night while I was in Paso Robles. Due to crappy Wi-Fi, it appeared that my post was lost and not auto-saved. However, when I got home, I found that a small portion was saved. I'll continue with what I started, and I'll be posting multiples to catch up on the other #Bloganuary prompts I missed.

Today's January 8th's #Bloganuary prompt is to write about what I like most about my writing. This is an interesting question. I could fill pages with what I don't like about my writing. Writing about what I do like is much harder.

Let's see. I feel my writing style is approachable, informative, and generally understandable.

There. I said something nice, now I can write about other things about writing for the rest of this post.

I recently read a tip to write for a single person (or two, if you count yourself). For bloggers like me, this is a dynamite tip. With the astronomical popularity of social media and services like Tik Tok, there is so much pressure for likes, views, etc. It's nice to come here and know that, primarily, I'm writing this for me. No comments? No problem. Now, that's not to say that I don't want comments (and please, please, leave your comments _here_ and not on social media if you clicked over from something like Facebook)!

Another thing I came across recently was a meme about double-spacing after periods. And all of these people were saying how they were never giving up their double space. Even though it's wrong. And ugly looking. I was taught to type that way, (even though I believe it was already wrong by that time, as I did not learn to type on a typewriter) and sometimes I find myself STILL adding that extra space. However, unlike those weirdos on Facebook, I do not WANT that stupid space in my writing. I tried to get MacOs to automatically replace " " with " ", however, it won't save an entry with only spaces. How rude!

And since I'm behind by 4 posts still, that's enough for this one.
