I found this site tonight, and it seems like an interesting way to waste a few minutes of time before going to sleep.... Here is a map of the United States of America. All the states in red are the ones I have visited. Admittedly, my visit to a few of these states -- Michigan for example -- has only been the airport... but I've still been there! ![](images/statemap?visited=AZARCADCDEFLHIIDIAMDMAMIMNMOMTNVNJNMNYNCOKORPASCTNTXVAWAWV)
