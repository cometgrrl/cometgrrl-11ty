It's that time again. Since it's New Year's Eve, it's probably appropriate to set some resolutions for the coming year. For 2004, I resolve to:- Face all challenges with a positive outlook
- Continue studying chemistry, obtain credit for chem 1A and take a real second semester chem class.
- Make better choices in dating such as not running from any guy who might actually be good for me, and to stop chasing the guys who are definitely never going to be right for me.
- Avoid getting into any relationship where the "Ex Factor" might come into play and cause problems. The "Ex Factor" is a term I use in a broad sense to describe any serious problem caused by an Ex. Some examples of the "Ex Factor" I've encountered personally are: - His parents loved the ex, and now he feels you'll never measure up in their eyes, so avoids telling them about you and eventually dumps you because he can't handle it. - He gets back together with his ex, leaving you hanging. They break-up (again), and he calls you. A word to the wise, even if they don't reconile again, you're still the rebound girl and he'll marry the girl he dates after his fling with you is over. - His ex did a number on him and even though he's had a crush on you for years and you are finally both single at the same time, he just isn't emotionally ready for dating. - He's still in love with his ex, and you're the just rebound / make her jealous fling.
HAPPY NEW YEAR! Here's to hoping 2004 brings everyone love and happiness or whatever we're all searching for.
