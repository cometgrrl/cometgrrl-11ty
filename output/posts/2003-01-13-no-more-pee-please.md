Bailey and I were having issues this weekend. Bailey feels that it is acceptable to pee on the carpet every 1/2 hour, while I tend to disagree with this behavior.

He certainly knows he's done wrong. He won't come near me once I've discovered a wet spot on the floor. And if I try to put his nose in it, he hollers and yelps like I'm killing him and then runs to his crate.

I'm thinking that the free supply of water is what's killing my house training efforts. He is simply drinking way too much at one time and then can't hold it.

Frustrating as it is, I still love him. We've even decided to allow him on the furniture now. It eliminates his continuous attempts at getting up and has made life much simpler. And he looks so cute laying on the couch next to Comet.
