I'm a little late writing this, but better late than never!

Last year, I read 57 books. Out of those 57, I rated only seven books as 5-star reads. Another 22 made the list with 4 stars. I won't include all of these in this post. Goodreads doesn't allow partial stars, so many of those are 3.5-star books that I've rounded up to 4 stars.

Let's start with the 5-star books.

- At the top of the list, we have my all-time favorite book, _Watership Down_. What can I say? _Watership Down_ is a story filled with adventure, a desire to seek a better life, spirituality, hope, and above all else, _bunnies!_

- _Lessons in Chemistry_ is a story of survival and challenging the status quo. Set in the 1960s, Elizabeth is not your average woman, and she is unwilling to settle for an average life.

- _The Dictionary of Lost Words_ is a beautiful story that mixes a love of words with a desire for more from life than what is currently expected or given to women of the time. Esme recognizes the power of words and, in her own way, fights to raise not only her own voice but the voices of all women.

- _Fairy Tale_ is an epic fantasy adventure. This is King's homage to fairy tales, and despite the mixed reviews it's received, I found it great.

- _Upgrade_, on the surface, is an action-packed book about what happens when humans start genetically engineering _humans._ Underneath that is a story of the moral dilemmas of modern technology and the idea of whether we should trade millions or billions of lives to engineer super-humans that can withstand disease and injury or whether we should engineer more compassion and empathy.

- Louise Penny continues to amaze me with her ability to craft delightful murder mysteries and characters with such depth and emotion. _A World of Curiosities (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, #18)_ does not disappoint and is, perhaps, my favorite of the entire series thus far. I recently learned there is also a TV adaptation, but as the actors seemed to have American accents, I was a little put off and haven't watched it yet.

- Last but not least, _Still Just a Geek: An Annotated Memoir._ I did not read Wil's original memoir, but I have followed his life in recent years, including reading some of his fiction work and, at times, his blog. Wil Wheaton is an incredibly brave, strong person for sharing intimate details of his traumatic childhood and a role model for speaking out about mental illness to reduce the associated stigma. My only complaint here is that, in the audio version, it's a little hard to follow what's the original and what's annotated.

The best of the 4-star books are:

- I've already reviewed _Maame_. You can find my full review here.

- _Fevered Star (Between Earth and Sky, #2)_ is an excellent follow-up to _Black Sun_. This is another that I've already reviewed, which you can find here.

- Gideon the Ninth (The Locked Tomb, #1) is a story of magic, specifically necromancy, and a wild, inventive story. On negative for me here was the audiobook. With dozens of characters with complex names and nicknames, I was often lost as to who was doing what.

- She Who Became the Sun (The Radiant Emperor, #1) is yet another book about a woman (or girl, in this case) wanting more from life than she's been given. Set in the 1300s, this is a clever mash-up of historical fiction and fantasy about an alternate China and the Mongol rule of the time.
