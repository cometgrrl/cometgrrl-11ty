I am not really into genealogy. My mom, however, is very into this stuff. I'm sure she could write pages and pages about it.

Me, on the other hand, I can tell you this:

- My parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all born in the United States.

- Before that, my ancestors came from Europe. England, Ireland, Scotland perhaps, Germany, and maybe Italy.

When I think of a family tree, I picture an actual tree, rather than just a tree-like diagram. The tree featured in this post is from a walk I took on Thanksgiving last year with my mom, step-father Michael, Indy, and Roxy.

Today's #Bloganuary prompt: **How far back in your family tree can youÂ go?**
