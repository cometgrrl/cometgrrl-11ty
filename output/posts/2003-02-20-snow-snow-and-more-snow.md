_Note from the future (2021): pictures were removed because I'm too lazy to go find and upload a picture of my car covered in snow._

It seems like Maryland got nothing but snow this past weekend. This storm even set the record for the largest snow accumulation ever. Blizzard of 1996 was put to shame.

And here's what my car looked like before I started shoveling.

2 hours of shoveling on Monday, then we went joy riding! HA! It was interesting, to say the least, but Robin and I made it safely to happy hour.

The roads are still messy around here. The snowplows managed to make every multi-lane road in this town into a one-lane snow tunnel. My office, unfortunately, has been open all week. Why couldn't something like this have happened while I was still in school? Classes at UMBC are canceled again for tomorrow, which will be the 4th day this week.
