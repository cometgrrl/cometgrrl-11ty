Several months ago, I discovered a local band The Spazmatics. They are an 80s cover band, and SO MUCH FUN!

I had plans to see them live last Friday, but since all the bars and basically everything is closed right now, that didn't happen.

Thankfully, they have been doing free Facebook live concerts on Friday night, and I convinced some friends (mostly Robin) to watch. But.... it's still just me here and texting while dancing is still dancing by yourself.

This was the highlight of my week, and while normally I would be embarrassed to admit that, not only do I admit it, but I'm going to share a video (GASP)!

Also, please please be nice, and no comments on my singing!!!
