I keep telling myself that I will review every book I read. Or, at least, more of the books I read.

And I keep not doing it.

Sometimes, I feel like it's a herculean task to get my thoughts about a book out of my mind and written out. Other times, I'm not sure I have enough unique thoughts to make it worth it.

I don't think either of those excuses is actually true. They are simply.... _excuses._

Instead of writing reviews for all the books I read last month, here's a recap.

## _The Gilded Ones (Deathless, #1)_

A solid fantasy adventure with great world-building and unique characters. This also follows my theme from 2022 of reading books about women who want more than they get.

★★★★

## _What If? 2: Additional Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (What If?, #2)_

These are hilarious and educational simultaneously.

★★★★

* * *

## _When Women Were Dragons_

Another book about strong women and the desire for more.

★★★★

* * *

## _Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts._

This is an excellent book about building trust, communicating opening, and being yourself. Highly recommend to anyone who works with others in a business setting or just wants tools to approach conflict better.

★★★★★

## _A Paris Apartment_

Historical fiction based on Marthe de Florian and the story of her Parisian apartment that was discovered, untouched for decades, in 2010. This book was recommended as part of my 12 books for 12 months of 2023 challenge. I don't think I would have picked it up on my own, and while parts of it were interesting, on the whole, I didn't care for this book.

★★
