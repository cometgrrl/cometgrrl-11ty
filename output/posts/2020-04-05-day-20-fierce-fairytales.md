As I mentioned earlier this week, I'm reading _Fierce Fairytales_ by Nikita Gill. This collection of poems and stories reminds me of the novels of Gregory Maguire. Ever seen the Broadway hit musical Wicked? That's probably his most famous novel.

Similar to Maguire, Gill is turning the fairytales on their heads, questioning what's truly good or evil. Is anyone or anything purely good or evil? Have we heard the whole story, or just part of the story? These are the questions that are asked, and sometimes answered in _Fierce Fairytales_.

I am wholeheartedly enjoying this, and I wanted to share this one quote with you.

> That idea ... it was you. You are the universe's fairytale come true.

> Fierce Fairytales by Nikita Gill

If you are in need of some inspiration or a different way of looking at things, at life, at yourself, the world around us, I highly, highly recommend reading this. Life is certainly not a fairytale -- but what if it was? What if the big bad wolf was really a friend? What made Cinderella's step-mother wicked and what made her step-sisters so awful? Everyone has a story, even the bad guys.
