Lost in Translation, which won an Oscar this year for best original screenplay, has to be one of the most boring movies I've seen recently. Now, that's not to say it was horrible, it just wasn't very good. I'm amazed it was nominated for Best Picture. I love Bill Murray, but they could have done so much more with this movie. It's the story of two married people, Bob who is an American movie star (Bill Murray) and Charlotte, a young woman (Scarlett Johansson), meeting while in Tokyo. There are some funny bits with Bill Murray filming a commercial for Scotch. Now, I know this is supposed to be a dramatic, poignant, soul-searching film about love that can never be between Charlotte (who's just out of college) and Bob, who's in his 50's... of course, if they were meant to be together, they would have left their spouses, or found someway to work it out. Someone who watched this movie with me fell asleep for a little bit in the middle and after waking up and watching the remainder of the movie said "I must have missed the good part." Only there wasn't any good part, it just drags on and on. With that said, the acting was great and the cinematography as well... it's just very lacking in the plot department. After 2 hours of watching Bob and Charlotte meet and spend time together in Tokyo, you learn about their dissatisfying lives, a little about them, and then, how does it end? They just go back to their lives like it never happened.
