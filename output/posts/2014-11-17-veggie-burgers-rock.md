![](images/FullSizeRender-e1416100742617-300x225.jpg)Ta-da! I finally made a veggie burger that didn't fall apart when I tried to cook it! Before this, I was almost ready to give up on homemade veg burgers. They pretty much never come out right, and typically I end up just taking what doesn't even remotely look like a burger, and putting it in a tortilla and calling it "veggie wrap". Tasty?  Yes, usually. But not the same as an actual burger.

Now this was a really delicious veggie burger! And yes, I'm weird and I don't really care for buns with my burgers, so you'll see in my photo that I eat them with ketchup, some gourmet mustard (this was tequila jalapeño mustard, which is totally awesome), and there's some cilantro on the side as well.

The credit all belongs to Jenn over at Peas & Crayons. The only modifications I made to the recipe are:

- I used a chia egg, made from chia seeds (not ground) and water
- I used whole flax seeds for the "extra" seeds
- I doubled the cayenne and the garlic cloves (but I skipped the garlic powder)

I did not make the taco aioli, as I'm not usually a fan of aioli, and I absolutely love burgers with mustard, which I have plenty of on hand.

I believe what makes this veggie burger work is the combination of the chia egg plus the ground oats. Other recipes I have tried called for things like rice, lentils, etc, maybe bread crumbs, but I think it was the chia egg and the ground oats that really held it together.

Roxy really enjoyed helping me make these as well. She loves sitting in the kitchen waiting for Mommy to drop food on the floor. I don't think she got much other than a few stray corn kernels, but that's enough to keep her happy.

Now I just have to work on making mine nice and round instead of all weirdly shaped. But regardless of shape, these were quite yummy!

I can't make falafel to save my life either, so I guess that's my next mission. I've tried a couple of recipes, even some stuff "falafel mix" that came in a box, but no luck yet. Or maybe I should just head over to Falafel's Drive-in where they make the yummiest falafel ever. I mean, who am I kidding? Mine will never taste that good.
