Today, I realized 2014 is very close! Where did 2013 go?? Looking at my goals, I am not going to be able to meet some of them.

Running

It will be close to beat my mileage from last year. There is no way I can make the stretch goal of 500 miles. As for races, I set out to run 6 this year, but I had to cancel a few due to travel, surgery, and injury. I ran the Lagoon Valley 10K, Santa Cruz 1/2, Disney 1/2, and I'm signed up for the Turkey Trot and the Santa Run. So that's 5, I guess I need to find a 6th.

Languages

I completed the "easy" version of the Spanish goal, and have finished Spanish 1. I'm almost 1/2 way through Spanish 2, so I will hopefully finish that this year. Spanish 3 will have to wait until next year. However, I have started using an app called Duolingo on my iPhone and practice/learn Spanish with that almost daily.

As for Romanian, I am hopeless.  I need someone like Duolingo or Fluenz to come out with something for me!

Reading the classics

Les Miserables was done early on this year, and I also read The Catcher in the Rye. I have sort of decided not to read On the Road, so maybe we can cross that off the list? That leaves Anna Karenina and Lolita. I'd really like to read both this year, but I'd settle for Anna Karenina. I purchased it months ago, but I have been reading a lot of books for book club, and I started a non-fiction specific meet-up within my book club group, so I haven't had a lot of free reading time.

All in all, I think I have done pretty well.  I can't believe that my running mileage is even close to what it was last year, considering all that's happened this year to sidetrack me from running.

QOTD:  Where are you with your goals for 2013?
