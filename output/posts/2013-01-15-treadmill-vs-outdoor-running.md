Thanks to my wonderful mom, I now have my very own treadmill!!!  No more running in the rain, the cold, or the dark.

But wait.  I LOVE running in the cold.  The rain, not so much, but I don't hate it.  And running in the dark I avoid, only because of safety issues and the lack of other people on the trails I run after dark.

Since I've had the treadmill (it's been assembled and running for about a week), I have run outside 0 times.  Even this weekend, when I had nice sunny but chilly weather.  My dog, Roxy, loves to go running with me too.

But here's what happens now.

Weekday mornings:  Gee, I could get up an hour early and run outside, or I could snooze the alarm.  So I snooze.  Then at 7pm (or sometimes 11pm), I start to feel guilty about skipping my run and hit the treadmill.

Weekend: Saturday was a special case because I had plans from 9am to 7pm -- it was dark when I got home.  And I don't do 6am runs on the weekends!  On Sunday though, I procrastinated just long enough that I didn't have time to fit in my scheduled 40 minute run. I did run, but at  9pm on the treadmill.

Poor Roxy hasn't been out running in over a week.
