the friday five

1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?  
    Sure, depends on the person tho! ;)
2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  
    Ummâ€¦. Kevin at work today.
3. About how many telephones do you have at home?  
    I don't use the phone at home, only my cell but there are tons of phones around here.
4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?  
    Yes, the last guy I dated. He would always say he'd call "that night" and then wouldn't. I got sick of it.
5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  
    Email works fine. It's good for keeping in touch with my friends and family that live far away, but the phone is much better for immediate planning. My ex used to email me to ask if I wanted to have dinner -- at 11pm at night!
