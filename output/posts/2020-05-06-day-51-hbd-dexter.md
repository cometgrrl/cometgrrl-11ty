It's hard to have a birthday party for a cat who is known as the "imaginary" cat.

Dexter is very shy, and spends most of the day sunning himself when he thinks no one is watching, otherwise, he's hiding under the bed.

My friend Robin dropped off decorations, and I even had birthday presents. But I couldn't get Dexter to come join the party. It took a lot of treats, and patience, and then he disappeared again after 30 seconds.

In the future, I think I will skip having a birthday part for Dexter. At least the dogs seem to enjoy the attention!

Also, Happy Cinco de Mayo! I celebrated with some homemade guac and a paloma.
