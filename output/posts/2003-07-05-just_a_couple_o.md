Just a Couple of Days This book is by Tony Vigorito, and was very fun to read. I have to admit, that I was a little hasty towards the end. Somewhat of a rush to finish, so that I could start _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. Perhaps I will come back to a Couple of Days, and read it again soon. It's getting quite late, or I would devote some more time, time appropriate for a proper review of the book... for now, suffice to say.... "Two thumbs up!"
