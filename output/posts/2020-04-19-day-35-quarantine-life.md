Things that you only realize when you're under quarantine and/or you spend an unusually high amount of time at home...

- You don't own enough spoons
- Finding the right screw is a pain in the ass
- It's even worse when Home Depot doesn't carry said screw in stock at the store (not that you want to go to Home Depot at this time anyway but still)
- Posting on social media asking friends to mail you a screw (and a nut) is weird
- Chores are somehow worse when you're home all the time
- The house gets dirtier when you're home all the time
- The dogs love it when you're home all the time
- The cat does not
- Binging TV does actually get old
- You're not good at puzzles
