Terror alert advice gets personal _(note from the future, the link doesn't work anymore)_

Federal officials are recommended that all Americans stock three days of food and supplies. This is scary.

I remember the crazy scares before Y2K and people building bomb shelters and such, but I never worried about that. Being computer literate and at least somewhat intelligent, I didn't see a major threat.

But biological and chemical warfare? This news has completely taken my mind off the fact that my trip to the Ukraine has been approved and I've even got a departure date of 4/1.

I believe that Bin Laden is a threat. Not only to Americans but to people everywhere. Saddam Hussein is also dangerous. I really, really don't want a war, and even as recent as yesterday I would have sided with France and said give the inspections more time. But with Bin Laden getting involved, I just don't see how we can avoid a war.

Make love not war……… (whenever possible, which appears not to be now)

**America will fight for freedom from terrorism**, I just hope we do it with full UN support.
