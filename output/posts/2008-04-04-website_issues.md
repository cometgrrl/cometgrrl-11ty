So for the last month or two, I have been having website issues. First off, I deleted the entire public\_html directory... OOPS! Luckily, I was able to recover everything, and was very happy to have everything back. Unfortunately, at this same time, i tried to upgrade to Movable Type version 4.1 (from a very old 3.2). My ISP doesn't give me ssh access, and the tools available just were NOT working. Finally, after many many hours and a lot of frustration on my part, I got it installed. Much to my horror, it was incredibly slow. There was just no way I was going to be able to use it. So then, I embarked on trying to figure out how to get back to version 3.2. I was able to do this, but it was not the solution. It was slightly faster after I reverted, yet still much slower than I was used to. Turns out my ISP has been having performance issues and despite my best efforts, they don't seem to want to help me. Yesterday, they announced maintenance would be done on the MySQL server and that new hardware would be added. And what do you know, it works now! I'm writing my very first entry with MT 4.1! I had a little snafu with my password being wrong, but I think that was they're issue, not mine. Now I can finally get to work on redesigning the site and weblog. More book / movie / video game reviews on the way!
