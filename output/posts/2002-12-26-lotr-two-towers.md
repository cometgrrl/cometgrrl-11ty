OK. I went to see LOTR - Two Towers this past weekend.

Let me just say this… if you were expecting the movie to be faithful to the book, don't get your hopes up. Naturally, they can't change any significant events, or else how would they make the third movie? My professional opinion (and please remember, I'm not a professional) can be found below. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read… I don't want to spoil it. If you haven't read the books, my complaints won't make sense.

Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers  
a review by none other than Cometgrrl =)

The Two Towers tries its best to stay as close to the words JRR Tolkien wrote and yet still manages to fail miserably. This is not to say it isn't wonderfully elaborate, with extravagant cinematography, and pretty damn good acting. At the time of this writing, I have only seen the movie once. I would like to view it again, this time to enjoy the movie for what it is -- a movie based on the novel. My first viewing was spent in a minor huff, fuming over this and that where the movie differs from the novel.

Some examples:  
In the movie, Elrond and the elves come to the battle at Helm's deep. In the novel, the Dun?dain (or Rangers) come to assist and save the day, not the elves.  
?omer is an exile from Rohan in the movie, whereas in the book he is merely on a mission for King Th?oden.  
Grishnakh is killed (stomped on, rather) by Treebeard, instead of by Ugl?k/the hobbits.  
The ents decide not to assist the Merry and Pippin by joining the war. That is, until Merry leads Treebeard closer to Isengard where he can see the ruin Saruman has inflicted upon the forest.  
Faramir is depicted to be much like his brother, Boromir, rather than fair and pure of heart as in the novel.  
The movie ends approximately 4 chapters shy of the ending of the novel.

These are just a few minor complaints. And now that I have fully vented over these differences, remember…. I still think it's a great movie.

Here's my 2 favorite quotes:

Gimli: Toss me!  
Aragorn: What!  
Gimli: I cannot jump the distance. You'll have to toss me.  
\[pause\]  
Gimli: Don't tell the elf!

Gollum: \[to Sam\] Stupid, fat hobbit!

In conclusion, if you have not yet viewed The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers -- what are you waiting for you stupid, fat hobbit!
