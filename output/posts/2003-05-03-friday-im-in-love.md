**Name one song you hate to admit you like.** Knocking Boots by Candyman…

**Name two songs that always make you cry.** Patience by Guns N' Roses...(not sure of #2 right now)

**Name three songs that turn you on.** Hmm… don't know if I care to publish this!

**Name four songs that always make you feel good.**

- BBQ by 2 Skinnee J's
