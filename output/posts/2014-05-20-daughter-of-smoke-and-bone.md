In world where angels and demons are at war, the humans are blissfully unaware.

Karu lives like a normal human, except that she was raised by Chimera and is aware of magic that allows granting of wishes.  Wishes such as turning her hair blue… forever.

Karu lives in Prague and passes as an almost normal teenage human girl. Secretly, she runs errands for a chimera is are the only family she's ever known. He makes trinkets that grant people wishes, and she doesn't ask questions.

Suddenly, a mysterious stranger, the likes of which Karu has never seen before, appears in her life.  Akiva, a seraphim, his race is at war with the chimera. And so the love story begins.

At first, I wasn't sure I would like this book, or the series. But little by little, I was drawn into the story and fell in love right along with Karu and Akiva.

Having read all three books in the trilogy, it's sort of blurred in my mind where the story ends in book 1, but I highly enjoyed all three books. If you like fantasy, and you're OK with the angels and demons overtones, you should check these out.

_Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this through NetGalley, in exchange for a fair and honest review._
