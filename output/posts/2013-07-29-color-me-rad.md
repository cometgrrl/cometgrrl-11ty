Earlier this month, I asked to be an ambassador for Color Me Rad!  What this means is in exchange for blogging about the race, I was given a free race entry and a discount code to share with my readers (you!).  So sign up now through Wednesday July 31, and enter the code "radfun" for 20% off the registration fee.  This code is good only for these three days, but is good for any race location!

Since Kari and Ashley already invited me to run with them, I thought this would be a cool opportunity. Normally, the races I sign up for are your typical road or trail run, and not themed or flashy. I did the Rave Run 5K earlier this year, and while fun, it was sort of disappointing.  I am hoping this will turn out to be a blast and something that we'll do every year.  :)
