#Bloganuary day 5: write about something you wish you knew how to do.

There a lot of things I wish I knew how to do. I could enumerate them here, but a list would be a pretty boring answer for this writing prompt.

In the spirit of picking just one thing – I wish I knew how to always be kind to myself.

I am more than my thoughts and my feelings. My thoughts are not always facts. _Everyone_ has negative thoughts, but we can choose to believe or not believe them. We can acknowledge them and let them go, rather than fretting over them or clinging to them.

Would I talk to a friend the way I (mentally) talk to myself ? _Absolutely not!_ Why is kindness reserved for others?

Now, I’m not a complete \*\*\*\* to myself! There is a lot of room for improvement though!

One related idea is impostor syndrome. I’d like to write more about it, so look for that in the future.
