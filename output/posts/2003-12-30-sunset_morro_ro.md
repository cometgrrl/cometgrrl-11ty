The sunset in Morro Bay, overlooking Morro Rock, is fantastic. It was so beautiful, I can't wait to go back in the summer when the weather is warmer so I can sit on the beach and enjoy it. Even with the bitter cold winds, and just getting over a nasty cold, we spent about an hour watching the sunset and taking photos. ![](images/Morro_Bay_Sunset.jpg) I'm sure Ryan's photos came out much better than mine, he's the photographer, not me. We had a good time, and Morro Bay was the perfect place. He was home in Cali for the holidays, and it worked out that Morro Bay was just about the halfway point for us to meet. I didn't realize how much I missed him since I moved back, it was good to see him again. We were planning on going to Hearst Castle as well, but couldn't make it since we didn't make reservations. Maybe next time.
