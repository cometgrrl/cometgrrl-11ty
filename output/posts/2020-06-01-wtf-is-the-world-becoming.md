I'm too angry and way too sad today to write a proper post. I'd love to share my thoughts on everything going on in America right now, but I just can't.

I've been crying on and off all weekend, and I'm taking a break from the news / the world for a few hours. Maybe tomorrow I'll feel up to writing about my thoughts and feelings on the matter.

I thought about posting an update on my puzzle, but given the current situation, it doesn't seem right.
