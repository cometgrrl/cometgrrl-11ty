**_1 When did you last feel sand between your toes?_**  In March, during my New Zealand vacation. I miss the beach!

**_2 When did you last have a sandwich?_**  Umm, I don't eat a lot of sandwiches, but probably a few months back when we ordered from Ike's at work. They have amazing vegan "chicken/turkey" subs.

_**3 What kinds of sandals do you own?**_  I own too many shoes. Flip flops, gladiators, I have lot of sandals because a) I hate socks and b) I live in California.

**_4 How trustworthy has the Sandman been these days?_**  Not too bad. I recently realized that my trouble sleeping is probably from sleeping too much. With no commute and no gym to go to, I've been getting up later but going to bed at the same time, I've been struggling with falling asleep and I think it's just literally because I'm not tired.

**_5 What do you know about San Diego?_**  It's a beautiful town in Southern California, there's a mission there (?), Balboa Park, the Globe Theatre, the gaslight district, the Zoo... isn't sea world near by? Oh and the Chargers, are they still in San Diego?
