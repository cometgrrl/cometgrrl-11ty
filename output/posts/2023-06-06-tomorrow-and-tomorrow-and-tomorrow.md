_Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_ by Gabrielle Zevin is a touching story about two socially awkward people and how their lives came to be entangled.

At its core, _Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_ is a story about love, friendship, and belonging. Our main characters, Sam and Sadie, seek belonging and companionship; apart from each other, they have trouble finding it. And even together, they find it only occasionally and often imperfectly.

The story spans more than 30 years. Sam and Sadie meet as children, drift apart, and reconnect later in life. They spent their lives immersed in the video game world, and I found this aspect of the story the most interesting. Having grown up in the same era as Sam and Sadie, I recognized many of the mentioned games. I also identified with Sadie's feelings about being a woman in a man's world.

While I did enjoy this more than Zevin's The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry, I can't say I loved it. It felt superficial at times, none of the characters were particularly likable, and in the end, I didn't care what happened to them. I just wanted them to get over themselves and stop always doing whatever was absolutely in their worst interests.

Ironically, when I finished it, I rated it five stars. I'm not quite sure why. Perhaps the end got to me?

★★★★
