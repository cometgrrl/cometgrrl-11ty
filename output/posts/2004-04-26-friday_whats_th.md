Well, Friday has come and gone once again. This past week, I barely noticed Friday. When you work 80+ hours in 6 days, when you don't leave the office until midnight and some days you come in at 4 in the morning, all the days tend to blend together. So, slightly delayed, here's the Friday Five for last week: The Friday Five Once again, there's no F5, so here's an old one that I've never answered. July 19, 2002 1. Where were you born? Houston, Texas 2. If you still live there, where would you rather move to? If you don't live there, do you want to move back? Why or why not? I do not want to move back to Houston. Even though I was born there, I moved to California at such a young age that I don't even remember living in Houston. I will always have a place in my heart for Texas, but I'm a California girl through and through. 3. Where in the world do you feel the safest? I feel safest when I'm in the arms of the person who loves me. It's a nice, sappy, romantic notion, isn't it? 4. Do you feel you are well-traveled? No. How can I be well-traveled when I've barely been outside of the continential US? 5. Where is the most interesting place you've been? There's so many to list. Each place on the list is interesting for different reasons, and each place I'd like to go back to again. - San Francisco - Los Angeles - New York - Memphis / Graceland - Seattle - British Columbia
