I know I already posted about the new look of the site, but I just wanted mention, for anyone who somehow doesn't know, the background picture is of my dog Comet.... isn't he cute? Comet is my best friend in the whole world, and he is the one person (wait, he's not a person), ahem, the one friend, that I can trust with anything. Of course, he can't drive me anywhere and refuses to wash dishes or help cook dinner. Oh and he snores and hogs the bed and the covers... but I love him anyway.
