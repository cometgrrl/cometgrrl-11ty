Where is Raed ?

> The most disturbing news today has come from Al-Jazeera, they said that nine B52 bombers have left the airfield in Britain and flying "presumably" towards Iraq as if they would be doing a spin around the block. Anyway, they have 6 hours to get here.

Where is Raed? is pretty interesting. Salam Pax is supposedly a young Iraqi posting to his weblog from Baghdad. Real or not, it is an insightful read and some of his posts have been dead on. He said that reports that the US bombed the Iraqi sattlelite channel were false -- turns out he was right.

GW better know what he's doing over there. I agree with Salam when he says that Iraqis support the fight for democracy in Iraq… but they don't want a war. Would any American today want a war _inside_ the US? For any reason? What accomplishments would be worth fighting a war on American soil?

It saddens me that we are at war. My trip to Ukraine has been canceled at my request. I'm not sure how safe or unsafe it would have been for me to actually be there, but I just wasn't comfortable going _anywhere_ outside of America while there is a war in progress. Ukraine may have actually been safer than staying here just miles from Washington, DC… but this is my country, my home.
