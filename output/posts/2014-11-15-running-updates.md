I've done a really poor job of meeting my running goals the last few months. After running the Capitola 1/2, I have missed a few races for various reasons, and I have not been doing the weekly miles that I would like.

I have been really looking forward to the Silicon Valley Turkey Trot this year, as this is the one 5k that I try to do every year, and use as my benchmark to see if I'm improving my PR. However, I just learned that I will be having surgery next week, and I will not be able to run for 4 weeks, so the Turkey Trot is out.

There's always the Santa Run, but I will just barely be able to run at that point, so I don't know that it's worth it to try to do any sort of races until next year.

I'm really bummed about this, and so I am trying to run, run, run these last few days leading up to my surgery, since I'll be sitting around doing a lot of nothing afterwards, especially the first week.

Are there any really great races coming up in 2015? I need some motivation to get back into training properly post surgery.

I'm considering the following so far:

- Brazen's Bay Breeze 10k - 2/14 (I ran the 5k last year, and it was fun and flat, so I thought I'd try the 10k this time)
- Brazen's Hellyer 5k - 2/28
- Capitola 1/2 marathon - 5/17  (I had a PR this year, despite horrible pain from my ITBS from mile 10 and on)
- Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5k

I'd like to add at least one more short run (5-10k) and one more 1/2 marathon (maybe in SF later in the year?)

If you know of a great run in my area, please let me know!  I'd also like to travel for a race sometime, I did that last year for the Disney 1/2 and it was a lot of fun.
