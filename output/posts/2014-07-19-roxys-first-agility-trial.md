Last weekend, Roxy and I participated in our first agility trial. Since it was our first time, I only entered us in three runs. Two rounds of Standard, and one Jumpers. We received qualifying scores (or "Qs") for all three, and we're now eligible for Standard level 2 with CPE!

In standard agility, the objective is to complete a series of 12-16 obstacles in the correct order for the fastest times. There are penalties for going off course, knocking a bar down on a jump, or taking an obstacle incorrectly (such as missing the yellow contact zones on some).  Jumpers is similar, but contains fewer types of obstacles, focusing primarily on jumps.

There are several other games, but I won't go into those now. We're competing again Aug 23-24, and Aug 31 - Sept 1 (both with USDAA) and we'll be doing a total of 15 runs! I'll go into more details about the other agility games after that match.

Going into this, Roxy and I had only attended one trial as spectators, one "fun" match, and a lot of lessons.

We had a really amazing time and we owe it all to our coach, Rachel Evers.

Check out how much fun we had in the video below....
