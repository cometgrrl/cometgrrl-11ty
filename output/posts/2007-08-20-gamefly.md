So, I finally broke down and signed up for GameFly! It's been fun so far, and it's nice to not worry about shelling out a lot of money for a game only to find out it sucks. Anyway, if you haven't tried it, you should. Use this link, and get me a free Wii and/or free membership for a year. http://friends.GameFly.com/r/8f8abfb0a0c8102a919d
