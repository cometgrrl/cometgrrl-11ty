Since we've been in quarantine, I thought it would be a great time to watch a lot of the movies I've been meaning to watch. However, I've been finding it really hard to sit through a whole movie. Over the last week or two, I started (and didn't finish) The Other Guys (I picked this because Dwayne Johnson is in it, but turns out it's only for about 30 seconds BOOOOOO), The Race to Witch Mountain (another movie with Dwayne), Hot Fuzz, Up, and Portrait of A Lady on Fire. The last one was primarily because it was late and I just wasn't in the mood for subtitles.

I did, however, really enjoy Onward, 21 and 22 Jump Street. I also recently re-watched some classics like Legally Blonde (including the sequel) and Fight Club. Oh, and the Tooth Fairy, which despite the horrible reviews, I really liked. And no, not just because Dwayne's in it.

I really miss going to the movies. It's funny, people always ask me why I spend the money, particularly since I usually go alone. Well -- I love the whole experience. I love the theatre, the big screen, popcorn. Oh, and it forces me to sit and pay attention. At home I get distracted by a million things.

The movie studios have pushed back a lot of this year's releases to next year, and I'm quite sad about that. I was really looking forward to Jungle Cruise, among others.

I'm actually watching Office Space as I write this.  
Also, not pictured is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which will certainly be in rotation at some point. And obviously, I'll watch American Pie before watching the second one.

In the meantime, this is my stack of movies I have queued up. I've seen all of these many times before, so I know even if I get distracted, that's ok. And I know I love them, so I don't have to worry about the movie being boring or disappointing for some other reason.
