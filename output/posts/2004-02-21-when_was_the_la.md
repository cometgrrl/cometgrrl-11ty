I'm actually on time this week! the friday five When was the last time you... 1. ...went to the doctor? I don't remember... but I had the flu and felt like crap. Within the last year or so. 2. ...went to the dentist? August, right before I left MD and lost my health insurance coverage. 3. ...filled your gas tank? Today. Driving all over (Santa Barbara and back twice in one week!) takes a lot of gas. 4. ...got enough sleep? Last night. Slept in really late the other day and it felt good to get lots of sleep. Pretty soon it's back to getting 7 hours instead of 10 to 12. 5. ...backed up your computer? Ummm. I backed up all the important stuff to CDs about a year and a half ago before I upgraded to XP. Good thing I did because I ended up reformatting the whole thing, even though it wasn't really necessary.
