![Pepper](images/199110_10150155954741480_5519501_n-300x224.jpg)<-- This is Pepper. He's the dog that started it all. He was found as a stray by a co-worker, who had him locked in the bathroom of her condo. I had a yard, so I agreed to keep him temporarily.

This also turned into finding a rescue that would take him. I did, and I was so happy to meet such nice, caring people, so I starting volunteering.

The rest is history.

_\*\* Not all of my foster dogs are pictured here. There were many fosters who were just "overnighters" for one night, and didn't get a good photo._
